<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p7"><b class="calibre3">Becoming a REAL Success</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A</b>s I speak around the country, people often ask me why I write</p>
<p class="calibre1">books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I've been asked that question so many times that I want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give you the answer before you begin reading the first chapter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  <i class="calibre4">Failing Forward, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  have  dedicated  my  life  to  adding  value  to  people.  It's  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason I teach conferences, record lessons on cassette, create</p>
<p class="calibre1">training  videos,  and  write  books.  It's  the  reason  I  lead  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization, The INJOY Group. I want to see people achieve. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to see each person I meet become a REAL success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  believe  that  to  succeed,  a  person  needs  only  four  things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You can remember them by thinking of the word  <i class="calibre4">REAL. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Relationships: </i> The  greatest  skill  needed  for  success  is  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability to get along with other people. It impacts every aspect</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  a  persons  life.  Your  relationships  make  you  or  they  break</p>
<p class="calibre1">you. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Equipping: </i> One of the most significant lessons I've learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  that  those  closest  to  you  determine  the  level  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">success. If your dreams are great, you achieve them only with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">team. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Attitude: </i> People's  attitudes  determine  how  they  approach</p>
<p class="calibre1">life  day  to  day.  Your  attitude,  more  than  your  aptitude,  will</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine your altitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Leadership: </i> Everything rises and falls on leadership. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire  to  lift  the  lid  on  your  personal  effectiveness,  the  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">way to do it is to increase your leadership skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>If you pick up any one of my books, you can be sure that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeks to add value in one of these four areas. I've written this</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular  book  to  change  your  <i class="calibre4">attitude </i> about failure. Read it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">absorb  it,  and  allow  it  to  help  you  turn  your  mistakes  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepping-stones  for  success.  My  desire  is  that  <i class="calibre4">Failing</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Forward </i> will add value to your life. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p7"><b class="calibre3">Who Are Average? </b></a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We are all failures—at least, all the best of us are. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—J. M. BARRIE</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">W</b>hat makes achievers excel? W h y do some people skyrocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">while  others  plummet?  You  know  what  I'm  talking  about.  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">can call it luck, blessing, or the Midas touch—call it whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  want.  But  the  truth  is  that  some  people  just  seem  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve  incredible  things  in  spite  of  tremendous  difficulties:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They  finish  in  the  top  5  percent  in  nationwide  sales  for  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">company after losing key accounts. They find ingenious ways</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  increase  profits  for  their  department  in  the  face  of  budget</p>
<p class="calibre1">cuts. They earn a graduate degree while raising two children as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a </p>
<p class="calibre1">single </p>
<p class="calibre1">parent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They </p>
<p class="calibre1">discover </p>
<p class="calibre1">awesome </p>
<p class="calibre1">business</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities  while  colleagues  don't  see  any  at  all.  Or  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">recruit winner after winner into their organization despite what</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks like an anemic labor pool. It doesn't matter what kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">work  they  do.  Wherever  they  are,  they  just  seem  to  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">things happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly  all  people  like  to  think  of  themselves  as  above</p>
<p class="calibre1">average. But achievers seem to leave "average" in the dust—</p>
<p class="calibre1">so far behind them that ordinary seems a distant memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a><b class="calibre3">WHAT’S THE ROOT OF ACHIEVEMENT? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">What makes the difference? Why do some people achieve so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much? Is i t . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  Family  background?  Having  a  good  family  growing  up  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something to be grateful for, but it's not a reliable indicator</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  achievement.  High  percentages  of  successful  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">come from broken homes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  Wealth?  No,  some  of  the  greatest  achievers  come  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">households  of  average  to  below-average  means.  Wealth  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  indicator  of  high  achievement,  and  poverty  is  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">guarantee of low achievement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Opportunity? You know, opportunity is a peculiar thing. Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">people with similar gifts, talents, and resources can look at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation,  and  one  person  will  see  tremendous  opportunity</p>
<p class="calibre1">while the other sees nothing. Opportunity is in the eye of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beholder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• High morals? I wish that were the key, but it's not. I've known</p>
<p class="calibre1">people with high integrity who achieve little. And I've known</p>
<p class="calibre1">scoundrels who are high producers. Haven't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  The  absence  of  hardship?  For  every  achiever  who  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoided  tragedy,  there's  a  Helen  Keller  who  overcame</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme disabilities or a Viktor Frankl who survived absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">horrors. So that's not it either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,  none  of  these  things  are  the  key.  When  it  comes  right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>down to it, I know of only one factor that separates those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">consistently  shine  from  those  who  don't:  <i class="calibre4">The  difference</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">between  average  people  and  achieving  people  is  their</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">perception  of  and  response  to  failure. </i> Nothing  else  has  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same  kind  of  impact  on  people's  ability  to  achieve  and  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplish whatever their minds and hearts desire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHAT YOU NEVER LEARNED IN SCHOOL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Soccer player Kyle Rote Jr. remarked, "There is no doubt in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind  that  there  are  many  ways  to  be  a  winner,  but  there  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">really only one way to be a loser and that is to fail and not look</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond the failure." How people see failure and deal with it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  they  possess  the  ability  to  look  beyond  it  and  keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving—impacts  <i class="calibre4">every  aspect </i> of their lives. Yet that ability</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems  difficult  to  acquire.  Most  people  don't  know  where  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start looking to get it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">There is no doubt in my mind that there are many ways to be a winner, but</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">there is really only one way to be a loser and that is to fail and not look beyond</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">the failure. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">—KYLE ROTE JR. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even positive people have a tough time learning how to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure positively. For example, I'm known to be a very positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">person.  (My  book  <i class="calibre4">The  Winning  Attitude </i> has  been  in  print  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  fifteen  years.)  But  I  haven't  always  been  good  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">failing  forward.  I  wasn't  properly  prepared  for  it.  It's  certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">not something they tried to teach me in school. And kids today</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>don't get it there either. In fact, the school environment often</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinforces  people's  worst  feelings  and  expectations  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take a look at some of my previous attitudes toward failure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and see if your experience was similar:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1.1 feared failure. </i> An experience I had in college, along with</p>
<p class="calibre1">my response to it, is typical of what many students encounter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the first day of class when I was a freshman, the professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked into my history of civilization class and boldly declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Half of you in this room will not pass this class." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  my  first  response?  Fear!  Up  to  that  time,  I  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">never failed a class. And I did not want to start failing all of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden.  So  the  first  question  I  asked  myself  was,  <i class="calibre4">What  does</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the  professor  want? </i> School  became  a  game  that  I  wanted  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I recall that I once memorized eighty-three dates for a test in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  class  because  my  teacher  believed  that  if  you  could  cite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dates, you had mastered the material. I got an A on the test, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  three  days  later,  I  had  forgotten  all  of  the  information.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed to avoid the failure I had feared, but I had not really</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplished anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2.1  misunderstood  failure. </i> What  is  failure?  As  a  child,  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought it was a percentage. Sixty-nine and lower meant failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seventy and above signified success. That thinking didn't help</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. Failure isn't a percentage or a test. It's not a single event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's a process. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3.  I  was  unprepared  for  failure. </i> When  I  graduated  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">college  with  my  bachelor's  degree,  I  finished  in  the  top  5</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent  of  my  class.  It  didn't  mean  a  thing.  I  had  played  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">school  game  successfully,  and  I  had  absorbed  a  lot  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>information. But I wasn't at all prepared for what was ahead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I found that out in my first job. As the pastor in a small rural</p>
<p class="calibre1">church, I worked very hard that first year. I did everything the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people might expect of me and then some. But to be honest, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was as concerned about getting everyone to like me as I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">with helping people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  type  of  church  I  led,  each  year  the  people  voted  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decide whether to allow the leader to keep his job. And many</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  leaders  I  knew  over  the  years  loved  to  brag  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unanimous affirming votes they received from their people. My</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectations  were  high  as  I  prepared  to  receive  my  first</p>
<p class="calibre1">unanimous  vote.  Imagine  my  surprise  when  the  votes  came</p>
<p class="calibre1">back 31 yeses, 1 no, and 1 abstention. I was devastated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After I went home that night, I called my father, who was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">veteran  pastor,  former  district  superintendent  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">denomination, and college president. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dad,"  I  lamented,  "I  can't  believe  it.  I  worked  so  hard  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">those people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I've  done  everything  I  can."  I  was  at  the  point  of  tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody actually voted against me and wanted me to leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  church! And  an  abstention  is  as  good  as  a  no.  Should  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave and go to another church?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">To my shock, I heard laughter on the other end of the phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, son, stay there," my dad said as he chuckled. "That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably the best vote you'll ever receive." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A NEW COURSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>At  that  moment  I  realized  what  an  unrealistic  view  I  had  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success  and  failure.  If  anything,  my  college  experience  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinforced  the  wrong  notions  I  had  about  failure. And  as  I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  leaders  to  grow  and  develop  through  the  years,  I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen that most people are in the same boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  <i class="calibre4">Leadership  Magazine, </i> J.  Wallace  Hamilton  states,  "The</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  of  suicides,  alcoholics,  and  even  some  forms  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">for success when they should be training for failure. Failure is</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>When  I  think  of  people  who  were  able  to  look  trouble  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye  and  forge  ahead,  one  of  the  first  who  comes  to  mind  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary Kay Ash. She has built quite an organization. During the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last four or five years, I've had many opportunities to speak to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the people in her cosmetics company about leadership. In fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as I travel around the country doing conferences and seminars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it seems that no matter where I speak, there are always at least</p>
<p class="calibre1">a dozen Mary Kay consultants in attendance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  admire  Mary  Kay.  She  overcame  a  lot  of  obstacles  in  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">career,  and  she  never  let  failure  get  the  better  of  her.  Mary</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kay's  first  career  was  in  direct  sales,  and  she  was  quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful. But she also found that it was difficult for a woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">to progress in the corporate world, especially in the 1950s and</p>
<p class="calibre1">early  1960s—even  after  twenty-five  years  of  success.  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">says, I had worked my way up to being a member of the board</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the company I was with only to find that, even though our</p>
<p class="calibre1">sales force was made up entirely of women, governed by an all</p>
<p class="calibre1">male board, my opinions were of no value. I constantly heard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary  Kay,  you  are  thinking  like  a  woman  again!"  I  felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejection in the worst form. So I decided to retire. <a href="index_split_003.html#p262">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Her retirement didn't last long. By the time a month passed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she was stir-crazy. She was ready to start her own business. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">she  was  going  to  encounter  obstacles,  they  would  be  there</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  because  she  brought  them  on  herself.  She  decided  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cosmetics business that would give every woman who worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">in it unlimited opportunities. She purchased the formulas to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best beauty products she'd ever found, worked up a marketing</p>
<p class="calibre1">plan, and prepared to set up a corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TROUBLE! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>It  didn't  take  long  for  her  to  hit  her  first  obstacle.  When  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">visited  her  attorney  to  make  legal  arrangements  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation,  he  insulted  her  and  predicted  her  failure.  "Mary</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kay,"  he  said,  "if  you  are  going  to  throw  away  your  life</p>
<p class="calibre1">savings, why don't you just go directly to the trash can? It will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  so  much  easier  than  what  you  are  proposing."  Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">accountant spoke to her in similar terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite their attempts to discourage her, she moved ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sank her $5,000 life savings into her new business—every</p>
<p class="calibre1">cent  she  had.  She  put  her  husband  in  charge  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">administrative  side  of  things  as  she  worked  feverishly  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepare the products, design the packaging, write the training</p>
<p class="calibre1">materials, and recruit consultants. They were making wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">progress.  But  then  a  month  before  she  was  to  open  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">business,  her  husband  died  of  a  heart  attack  right  at  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people would never have been able to go on after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  would  have  accepted  defeat  and  faded  away.  But  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary  Kay.  She  kept  going,  and  on  September  13,  1963,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">launched her business. Today, the company has more than $1</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion  in  annual  sales,  employs  3,500  people,  and  empowers</p>
<p class="calibre1">500,000 direct-sales consultants in 29 markets worldwide<a href="index_split_003.html#p262">.2</a> And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary  Kay  Ash  has  received  just  about  every  award  an</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">QUESTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>When I was growing up, one of the questions I used to hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  motivational  speakers  was  this:  "If  the  possibility  of</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">If your perception of and response to failure were changed, what would you</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">attempt to achieve? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That seemed to me to be an intriguing question. At the time</p>
<p class="calibre1">it prompted me to look ahead to life's possibilities. But then one</p>
<p class="calibre1">day I realized that it was really a bad question. Why? Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it takes a persons thinking down the wrong track. There is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievement  without  failure.  To  even  imply  that  it  might  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible gives people the wrong impression. So here's a better</p>
<p class="calibre1">question:  If  your  perception  of  and  response  to  failure  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed, what would you attempt to achieve? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know what obstacles you are facing in your life right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now. But whatever they are doesn't matter. What  <i class="calibre4">does </i> matter is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  your  life  can  change  if  you're  willing  to  look  at  failure</p>
<p class="calibre1">differently. You have the potential to overcome any problems, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes,  or  misfortunes.  All  you  have  to  do  is  learn  to  fail</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">O</b>n August 6, 1999, a major-league baseball player stepped up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to home plate in Montreal and made another out—the 5,113th</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  his  professional  career.  That's  a  lot  of  trips  to  the  batter's</p>
<p class="calibre1">box  without  a  hit!  If  a  player  made  all  of  those  outs</p>
<p class="calibre1">consecutively,  and  he  averaged  four  at  bats  per  game,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  play  eight  seasons  (1,278  games  straight)  without  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaching first base! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was the player discouraged that night? No. Did he think he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had failed himself or his team? No. You see, earlier in the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">game,  in  his  first  plate  appearance,  that  player  had  reached  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">milestone  that  only  twenty-one  other  people  in  the  history  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">baseball have ever achieved. He had made his 3,000th hit. That</p>
<p class="calibre1">player was Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During that game, Tony got on base with hits four times in</p>
<p class="calibre1">five tries. But that's not the norm for him. Usually he  <i class="calibre4">fails </i> to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">a hit two times out of every three attempts. Those results may</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  sound  very  encouraging,  but  if  you  know  baseball,  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize that Tony's ability to succeed consistently only one</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  in  three  tries  has  made  him  the  greatest  hitter  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation. And Tony recognizes that to get his hits, he has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make a lot of outs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I've been a Tony Gwynn fan for more than a decade. When I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>lived in San Diego, I had season tickets to the Padres' games. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  him  play  in  his  first  game  there.  And  I've  continued  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow his career closely. As he approached hit number 3,000, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew I wanted to be at the game when he achieved that feat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the day he was expected to achieve that milestone, I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  finished  teaching  leadership  at  a  conference  in  Chicago, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  I  was  to  be  speaking  in  Philadelphia  the  next  day.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrambled to change my plane tickets. Then I called my son-in-</p>
<p class="calibre1">law,  Steve,  who  was  going  to  be  at  the  next  conference  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, to invite him along. And each of us hopped on a plane to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Montreal for the game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  traveled,  I  knew  our  schedule  would  be  tight,  but  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">figured  we  could  make  it.  When  we  arrived  at  the  airport, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everything looked great. But after getting off the plane, Steve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got  tied  up  in  customs.  With  the  clock  ticking  away,  I  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty sure that we were going to miss Tony's first at bat. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  enough,  by  the  time  we  reached  the  stadium,  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">already batted and hit number 3,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HOW DO YOU DEFINE FAILURE? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">One of the greatest problems people have with failure is that they are too quick</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">to judge isolated situations in their lives and label them as failures. Instead, </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">they need to keep the bigger picture in mind. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When we realized that we were probably going to miss Tony's</p>
<p class="calibre1">historic  moment,  did  we  give  up?  No.  When  we  got  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stadium and  <i class="calibre4">k new </i> we had missed it, did we turn around and go</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>home?  No.  Did  I  think  I  had  failed  when  I  tried  to  buy  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">program but learned that the vendors had already sold out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them?  No.  You  see,  we  were  just  glad  to  be  a  part  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">celebration. And  like  Tony,  who  keeps  hanging  in  there  until</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  gets  his  hits,  we  were  rewarded.  Late  in  the  game  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tony hit a foul ball into the stands, I got it. A few weeks later</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tony signed the ball for me, and now I have a souvenir from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his 3,000-hit game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the greatest problems people have with failure is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are too quick to judge isolated situations in their lives and</p>
<p class="calibre1">label  them  as  failures.  Instead,  they  need  to  keep  the  bigger</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture in mind. Someone like Tony Gwynn doesn't look at an</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  that  he  makes  and  think  of  failure.  He  sees  it  within  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">context  of  the  bigger  picture.  His  perspective  leads  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">perseverance.  His  perseverance  brings  longevity.  And  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">longevity gives him opportunities for success. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FAILURE IS NOT... </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Changing  your  perspective  on  failure  will  help  you  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">persevere—and  ultimately  achieve  your  desires.  So  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">should you judge failure? Let's start by taking a look at seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">things failure is  <i class="calibre4">not:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. People Think  Failure Is Avoidable—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody fails, errs, and makes mistakes. You've heard the</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying  "To  err  is  human,  to  forgive  divine." Alexander  Pope</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  that  more  than  250  years  ago.  And  he  was  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">paraphrasing  a  saying  that  was  common  2,000  years  ago, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>during the time of the Romans. Things today are the same as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were then: If you're a human being, you're going to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're  probably  familiar  with  Murphy's  Law  and  the  Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Principle.  Recently  I  came  across  something  called  Rules  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Being Human. I think the list describes well the state we're in as</p>
<p class="calibre1">people:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule #1: You will learn lessons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule #2: There are no mistakes—only lessons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule #3: A lesson is repeated until it is learned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule #4: If you don't learn the easy lessons, they get  <i class="calibre4">harder. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(Pain is one way the universe gets your attention.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule  #5:  You'll  know  you've  learned  a  lesson  when  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  see,  writer  Norman  Cousins  was  right  when  he  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The essence of man is imperfection." Know that you're going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to make mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. People Think  Failure Is an Event—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Growing  up,  I  thought  that  failure  came  in  a  moment.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">best example I can think of is taking a test. If you got an F, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant  you  failed.  But  I've  come  to  realize  that  failure  is  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">process. If you flunk a test, it doesn't mean you failed a one-</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  event.  The  F  shows  that  you  neglected  the  process</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading up to the test. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>In 1997,I wrote a book called  <i class="calibre4">The  Success  Journey. </i> It offers</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  overview  on  what  it  means  to  be  successful.  In  it  I  define</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">success </i> in these terms:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing your purpose in life</p>
<p class="calibre1">Growing to reach your potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sowing seeds that benefit others</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thesis of the book is that success is not a destination—</p>
<p class="calibre1">not a place where you arrive one day. Instead, it is the journey</p>
<p class="calibre1">you take. And whether you succeed comes from what you do</p>
<p class="calibre1">day to day. In other words, success is a process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure  works  the  same  way.  It's  not  someplace  you  arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as success is not an event, neither is failure. It's how you</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal with life along the way. No one can conclude that he has</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed  until  he  breathes  his  last  breath.  Until  then,  he's  still  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">process, and the jury is still out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. People Think  Failure Is Objective—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  you  err—whether  you  miscalculate  crucial  figures, </p>
<p class="calibre1">miss  a  deadline,  blow  a  deal,  make  a  poor  choice  concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  children,  or  otherwise  fumble  a  ball—what  determines</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether that action was a failure? Do you look at the size of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem it causes or the amount of money it costs you or your</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization? Is it determined by how much heat you have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  from  your  boss  or  by  the  criticism  of  your  peers?  No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure  isn't  determined  that  way.  The  answer  is  that  <i class="calibre4">y o u </i> are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the only person who can really label what you do a failure. It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjective. Your perception of and response to your mistakes</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine whether your actions are failures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">You are the only person who can really label what you do a failure. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>Did you know that entrepreneurs almost never get their first</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  off  the  ground?  Or  their  second?  Or  their  third? </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Tulane  University  business  professor  Lisa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amos, the average for entrepreneurs is 3.8 failures before they</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally make it in business. They are not deterred by problems, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes, or errors. Why? Because they don't see setbacks as</p>
<p class="calibre1">failures. They recognize that three steps forward and two steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">b a c k  <i class="calibre4">st i l l </i> equals  one  step  forward.  And  as  a  result,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcome the average and become achievers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. People Think  Failure Is the Enemy—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  people  try  to  avoid  failure  like  the  plague.  They're</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid of it. But it takes adversity to create success. NBA coach</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rick Pitino states it even more strongly. "Failure is good," he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says. "It's fertilizer. Everything I've learned about coaching I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned from making mistakes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  who  see  failure  as  the  enemy  are  captive  to  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  conquer  it.  Herbert  V.  Brocknow  believes,  "The  fellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  never  makes  a  mistake  takes  his  orders  from  one  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">does." Observe any high achiever, and you'll discover a person</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  doesn't  see  a  mistake  as  the  enemy.  That's  true  in  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">endeavor.  Musicologist  Eloise  Ristad  emphasizes  that  "when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we give ourselves permission to fail, we at the same time give</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves permission to excel." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">People Think  Failure Is Irreversible—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There's an old saying in Texas: "It doesn't matter how much</p>
<p class="calibre1">milk  you  spill  as  long  as  you  don't  lose  your  cow."  In  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">words,  mistakes  are  not  irreversible.  Keep  everything  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective. The problems come when you see only the spilled</p>
<p class="calibre1">milk and not the bigger picture. People who correctly see failure</p>
<p class="calibre1">take it in stride. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>Mistakes don't make them want to give up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Success doesn't make them think that they are set up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every event—whether good or bad—is one small step in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">process  of  living.  Or  as  Tom  Peters  acknowledges,  "If  silly</p>
<p class="calibre1">things were not done, intelligent things would never happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">6. People Think  Failure Is a Stigma—It's Not </i> Mistakes are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">permanent markers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  love  the  perspective  of  the  late  Senator  Sam  Ervin  Jr.,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked,  "Defeat  may  serve  as  well  as  victory  to  shake  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul and let the glory out." That's the way we need to look at</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The average for entrepreneurs is 3.8 failures before they finally make it in</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">business. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When you make mistakes, don't let them get you down. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't let yourself think of them as stigmas. Make each failure a</p>
<p class="calibre1">step to success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  <i class="calibre4">People Think  Failure Is Final—It's Not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even what may appear to be a huge failure doesn't need to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep you from achieving. Consider the story of Sergio Zyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  the  mastermind  behind  New  Coke,  something  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketing  consultant  Robert  McMath  sees  as  one  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest product failures of all time. <a href="index_split_003.html#p263">1</a> Zyman, who successfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced  Diet  Coke,  believed  that  Coca-Cola  needed  to  act</p>
<p class="calibre1">boldly  to  reverse  its  twenty-year  market  decline  against  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">rival, Pepsi. His solution was to stop offering the drink that had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  popular  for  nearly  one  hundred  years,  change  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><img src="index-32_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">formula, and offer it as New Coke. The move was an abysmal</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure  that  lasted  seventy-nine  days  in  1985  and  cost  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">company  about  $100  million.  People  hated  New  Coke. And  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused Zyman to leave the company. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Steps to Success</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">But Zyman's problems with New Coke didn't keep him down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Years  later  when  asked  if  the  venture  was  a  mistake,  Zyman</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers, "No, categorically." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A failure? "No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A blunder, a misstep, a bust? "Another word between 'bust' </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,  uh,  something  else,"  he  replies.  "Now  if  you  say  to  me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'The strategy that you guys embarked on didn't work,' I'll say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Yeah,  absolutely  it  didn't  work.'  But  the  totality  of  the  action</p>
<p class="calibre1">ended  up  being  positive."  Ultimately  the  return  of  Coca-Cola</p>
<p class="calibre1">Classic made the company stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zyman's  assessment  was  confirmed  by  Roberto  Goizueta, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>the  late  chairman  and  chief  executive  of  the  Coca-Cola</p>
<p class="calibre1">Company. He rehired Zyman at Coca-Cola in 1993. "Judge the</p>
<p class="calibre1">results,"  said  Goizueta.  "We  get  paid  to  produce  results.  We</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't get paid to be right." <a href="index_split_003.html#p263">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU LOOK AT IT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you tend to focus on the particular events in your life, try to</p>
<p class="calibre1">put  things  into  perspective.  When  you  do,  you'll  be  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">share  the  philosophy  of  someone  such  as  the  apostle  Paul, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who was able to say, "I have learned in whatever state I am, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be content." <a href="index_split_003.html#p263">3 </a>And that was saying a lot, considering that Paul</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  shipwrecked,  whipped,  beaten,  stoned,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">imprisoned.  Throughout  everything,  his  faith  enabled  him  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintain perspective. He realized that as long as he was doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  he  was  supposed  to  do,  his  being  labeled  success  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure by others really didn't matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  person's  life  is  filled  with  errors  and  negative</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences. But know this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Errors become mistakes</p>
<p class="calibre1">when we perceive them and respond to them incorrectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mistakes become failures</p>
<p class="calibre1">when we  <i class="calibre4">continually </i> respond to them incorrectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  who  fail  forward  are  able  to  see  errors  or  negative</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences as a regular part of life, learn from them, and then</p>
<p class="calibre1">move on. They persevere in order to achieve their purpose in</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington  Irving  once  commented,  "Great  minds  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">purposes;  others  have  wishes.  Little  minds  are  subdued  by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>misfortunes; but great minds rise above them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  terrible  truth  is  that  all  roads  to  achievement  lead</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the land of failure. It has stood firmly between every</p>
<p class="calibre1">human  being  who  had  a  dream  and  the  realization  of  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream.  The  good  news  is  that  anyone  can  make  it  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure.  That's  why  author  Rob  Parsons  maintained  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">"tomorrow belongs to the failures." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too many people believe that the process is supposed to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">easy. The prolific American inventor Thomas Edison observed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that attitude among people. And this is how he responded to it:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Errors become mistakes when we perceive them and respond to them</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">incorrectly. Mistakes become failures when we </b></i><b class="calibre3">continually  <i class="calibre4">respond to them</i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">incorrectly. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure  is  really  a  matter  of  conceit.  People  don't  work  hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">because, in their conceit, they imagine they'll succeed without</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever making an effort. Most people believe that they'll wake up</p>
<p class="calibre1">some day and find themselves rich. Actually, they've got it half</p>
<p class="calibre1">right, because eventually they wake up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of us has to make a choice. Are we going to sleep life</p>
<p class="calibre1">away, avoiding failure at all costs? Or are we going to wake up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  realize  this:  <i class="calibre4">Failure  is  simply  a  price  we  pay  to  achieve</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">success. </i> If  we  learn  to  embrace  that  new  definition  of  failure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then we are free to start moving ahead—and failing forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOVING FORWARD ON THE HEELS OF TRAGEDY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Over dinner, I heard a great story about the price someone paid</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  achieve  success.  It  all  started  when  I  arranged  for  two</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>friends  to  meet.  Last  year  when  speaking  for Auntie Anne's</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pretzels, I was talking to Anne Beiler, the company's founder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we talked, she mentioned in passing that one of her heroes</p>
<p class="calibre1">is Truett Cathy, the founder of the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you like to meet him?" I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know him?" Anne responded, a little surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I sure do," I answered. When we moved my company, The</p>
<p class="calibre1">INJOY Group, to Atlanta in 1997, Truett and his son Dan Cathy</p>
<p class="calibre1">took all of us under their wings. "They're wonderful friends. I'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrange for all of us to have dinner together." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  immediately  set  a  date,  and  soon  afterward  my  wife, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Margaret, and I had Truett Cathy, Anne and Jonas Beiler, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dan  and  Rhonda  Cathy  over  to  dinner.  We  had  a  wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. I was amazed as Anne and Dan (who is the president of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chick-fil-A  International)  openly  exchanged  trade  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">about their businesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was pleased because I could tell they were enjoying a good</p>
<p class="calibre1">connection.  But  the  highlight  of  the  evening  for  me  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing Truett Cathy tell the story of his start in the restaurant</p>
<p class="calibre1">business and how that led to the founding of Chick-fil-A. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HOW IT ALL BEGAN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Truett's description of his childhood activities showed me that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was a born entrepreneur. As a second grader, he discovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he could buy a six-pack of Cokes for a quarter, sell them</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a nickel apiece, and make a 20 percent profit. It wasn't long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before he was buying soft drinks by the case, icing them down, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>and  increasing  his  revenue  and  profit.  When  the  weather</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned cold and drink sales lagged, he sold magazines. Then at</p>
<p class="calibre1">age eleven, he started helping a neighbor with his paper route. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By age twelve, he had his own route. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like many young men of his era, Truett went into the army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  he  was  discharged  in  1945,  he  was  ready  to  pursue</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity.  What  appealed  to  him  was  a  restaurant,  and  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream was to work with Ben, one of his brothers. After learning</p>
<p class="calibre1">a little about the business, they scraped together some money, </p>
<p class="calibre1">located  a  site,  built  a  restaurant,  and  opened  it  as  the  Dwarf</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grill (later the Dwarf House) in Hapeville, Georgia, on the south</p>
<p class="calibre1">side  of  Atlanta.  It  was  open  twenty-four  hours,  six  days  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week,  and  though  it  required  an  incredible  amount  of  work,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  profitable  from  the  first  week.  But  it  wouldn't  be  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before Truett faced the first of several major setbacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TRAGIC LOSSES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  came  early,  only  three  years  after  opening  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">restaurant.  Truett's  two  brothers  were  in  a  small  private  plane</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  crashed  on  the  way  to  Chattanooga,  Tennessee.  Both  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them  died.  Losing  a  business  partner  is  tough.  Losing  both</p>
<p class="calibre1">brothers was horrible. Truett was devastated. Once he got over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  emotional  shock,  he  went  on  alone. A  year  later,  he  paid</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eunice, his brother Ben's widow, for her share in the business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A year after that, he opened a second restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  then  things  were  going  pretty  well.  Then  one  night  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was awakened by a phone call; there was a fire at his second</p>
<p class="calibre1">restaurant location. He dashed off to see what could be done, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>but  when  he  arrived,  he  discovered  that  the  fire  had  totally</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroyed  the  operation.  That  alone  was  bad  enough.  Worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the fact that he had practically no insurance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  but  a  few  weeks  Truett  faced  another  debilitating</p>
<p class="calibre1">setback.  He  discovered  that  he  had  polyps  in  his  colon  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  to  be  removed.  The  timing  couldn't  be  worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  rebuilding  his  restaurant,  he  went  in  for  surgery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One operation turned into two, and much to his dismay, he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of action for several months—an eternity for an energetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman like him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TURNING LEMONS INTO LEMONADE . . . </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AND CHICKEN SANDWICHES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">What  does  an  active  entrepreneur  do  when  he's  stuck  in  bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for months at a time? If he's Truett Cathy, he comes up with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">million-dollar  idea.  The  time  Truett  spent  out  of  commission</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspired him to play with a new concept. He had always loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">chicken,  and  it  had  been  an  important  part  of  the  Dwarf</p>
<p class="calibre1">House's fare. For a while the restaurant had offered a boneless</p>
<p class="calibre1">chicken breast on its menu.  <i class="calibre4">What would happen, </i> he wondered, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">if I took  that chick en breast, seasoned and fried it just right, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and  put  it  on  a  bun  with  the  right  condiments? </i> The  answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">became  the  Chick-fil-A  Sandwich  and  the  start  of  one  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">largest privately owned restaurant chains in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today  Truett  Cathy  is  credited  with  inventing  the  chicken</p>
<p class="calibre1">sandwich  in  the  fast-food  industry.  Chick-fil-A  operates  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  nine  hundred  restaurants  across  the  country  and  has  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">200,000-square-foot  headquarters  that  sits  on  seventy-three</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>acres just south of Atlanta. In the year 2000, it became a billion-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dollar company. It is one of the most successful operations in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the restaurant business, selling millions of chicken sandwiches</p>
<p class="calibre1">and countless gallons of its famous fresh-squeezed lemonade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  business  .continues  growing.  Yet  it  never  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">come to pass if Truett Cathy had not experienced the setbacks</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  did,  maintained  his  perspective,  and  realized  that  a  few</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">I</b>n  an  interview  years  ago,  David  Brinkley  asked  advice</p>
<p class="calibre1">columnist  Ann  Landers  what  question  she  most  frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">receives from readers. Her answer: "What's wrong with me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Landers's response reveals a lot about human nature. Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  wrestle  with  feelings  of  failure,  the  most  damaging</p>
<p class="calibre1">being  doubtful  thoughts  about  themselves.  At  the  heart  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  doubts  and  feelings  is  one  central  question:  Am  I  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure?  And  that's  a  problem  because  I  believe  it's  nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible  for  any  person  to  believe  he  is  a  failure  and  fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that advice columnists (such as Ann Landers) and</p>
<p class="calibre1">humor  writers  recognize  that  keeping  a  good  perspective  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself  is  important  to  overcoming  adversity  and  mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The late Erma Bombeck, who wrote a widely syndicated weekly</p>
<p class="calibre1">humor column until a few weeks before her death in 1996, had a</p>
<p class="calibre1">firm  grasp  on  what  it  meant  to  persevere  and  fail  forward</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>Erma  Bombeck  traveled  a  road  that  was  filled  with  adversity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">starting  with  her  career.  She  was  drawn  to  journalism  early  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">life.  Her  first  job  was  as  a  copy  girl  at  the  Dayton  <i class="calibre4">Journal-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Herald </i> when  she  was  a  teenager.  But  when  she  went  off  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">college at Ohio University, a guidance counselor advised her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget  about  writing."  She  refused.  Later  she  transferred  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the University of Dayton and in 1949 graduated with a degree</p>
<p class="calibre1">in English. Soon afterward she began working as a writer—for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the obituary column and the women's page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That year adversity carried over into her personal life. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">she  got  married,  one  of  her  deepest  desires  was  to  become  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother. But much to her dismay, her doctors told her she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable  of  having  children.  Did  she  give  up  and  consider</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself  a  failure?  No,  she  and  her  husband  explored  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibility of adoption, and then they adopted a daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two years later, a surprised Erma became pregnant. But even</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  brought  her  more  difficulties.  In  four  years,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">experienced  four  pregnancies,  but  only  two  of  the  babies</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1964,  Erma  was  able  to  convince  the  editor  of  a  small</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighborhood  newspaper,  the  <i class="calibre4">Kettering-Oak wood  Times, </i> to</p>
<p class="calibre1">let her write a weekly humor column. Despite the pitiful $3 per</p>
<p class="calibre1">article she was paid, she kept writing. And that opened a door</p>
<p class="calibre1">for her. The next year she was offered the opportunity to write</p>
<p class="calibre1">a three-times-a-week column for her old employer, the Dayton</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Journal-Herald. </i> By  1967,  her  column  was  syndicated  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried by more than nine hundred newspapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  slightly  more  than  thirty  years  Erma  wrote  her  humor</p>
<p class="calibre1">column.  During  that  time,  she  published  fifteen  books,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized as one of the twenty-five most influential women in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>America,  appeared  frequently  on  the  television  show  <i class="calibre4">Good</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MORE THAN HER SHARE OF PROBLEMS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But  during  that  span  of  time,  Erma  Bombeck  also  experienced</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredible  troubles  and  trials  including  breast  cancer,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mastectomy,  and  kidney  failure.  And  she  wasn't  shy  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharing her perspective on her life experiences:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  speak  at  college  commencements,  and  I  tell  everyone  I'm  up  there  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they're  down  there,  not  because  of  my  successes,  but  my  failures.  Then  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceed  to  spin  all  of  them  off—a  comedy  record  album  that  sold  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">copies  in  Beirut  .  .  .  a  sitcom  that  lasted  about  as  long  as  a  donut  in  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">house  .  .  .  a  Broadway  play  that  never  saw  Broadway  .  .  .  book  signings</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  I  attracted  two  people:  one  who  wanted  directions  to  the  restroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the other who wanted to buy the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  you  have  to  tell  yourself  is,  "I'm  not  a  failure.  I  failed  at  doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">something." There's a big difference Personally and career-wise, it's been a</p>
<p class="calibre1">corduroy  road.  I've  buried  babies,  lost  parents,  had  cancer,  and  worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">over kids. The trick is to put it all in perspective . . . and that's what I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a living. <a href="index_split_003.html#p264">1</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">difference. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That point of view kept Erma Bombeck down to earth. (She</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked  to  refer  to  herself  as  "a  former  homeroom  mother  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>obituary writer.") It also kept her going—and writing—through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  disappointments,  the  pain,  the  surgeries,  and  the  daily</p>

<p class="calibre1">Every  successful  person  is  someone  who  failed,  yet  never</p>
<p class="calibre1">regarded  himself  as  a  failure.  For  example,  Wolfgang  Mozart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  the  geniuses  of  musical  composition,  was  told  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emperor Ferdinand that his opera  <i class="calibre4">The Marriage of Figaro </i> was</p>

<p class="calibre1">Vincent  van  Gogh,  whose  paintings  now  set  records  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sums  they  bring  at  auction,  sold  only  one  painting  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifetime.  Thomas  Edison,  the  most  prolific  inventor  in  history, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  considered  unteachable  as  a  youngster.  And  Albert</p>
<p class="calibre1">Einstein, the greatest thinker of our time, was told by a Munich</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">in spite of that,they persevere. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  think  it's  safe  to  say  that  all  great  achievers  are  given</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiple  reasons  to  believe  they  are  failures.  But  in  spite  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,  they  persevere.  In  the  face  of  adversity,  rejection,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">failings,  they  continue  believing  in  themselves  and  refuse  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider themselves failures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">FAILING FORWARD IS NOT FALSE SELF-</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ESTEEM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the last twenty years, test scores plummet and their desire to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn  decline,  they  have  tried  to  find  ways  to  reverse  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">trends. One popular theory states that the best way to improve</p>
<p class="calibre1">children's  ability  is  to  puff  up  their  self-esteem.  When</p>
<p class="calibre1">educators observed that high achievers possessed confidence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they theorized that if they simply built self-esteem, competence</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  follow.  But  that  approach  has  backfired  on  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Researchers  have  found  that  simply  building  children's  egos</p>
<p class="calibre1">breeds many negative traits: indifference to excellence, inability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to overcome adversity, and aggressiveness toward people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticize them. <a href="index_split_003.html#p264">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,  I  place  high  value  on  praising  people,  especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">children. In fact, I believe that people live up to your level of</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectations.  But  I  also  believe  that  you  have  to  base  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise  on  truth.  You  don't  make  up  nice  things  to  say  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">others. Here's the approach I use to encourage and lead others:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Value people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Praise effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reward performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I use that method with everyone. I even use a form of it with</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself.  When  I'm  working,  I  don't  give  myself  a  reward  until</p>
<p class="calibre1">after  the  job  is  finished.  When  I  approach  a  task  or  project,  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">give it my very best, and no matter what the results are, I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  clear  conscience.  I  have  no  problem  sleeping  at  night. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">no matter where I fail or how many mistakes I make, I don't let it</p>
<p class="calibre1">devalue my worth as a person. As the saying goes, "God uses</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>people who fail—'cause there aren't any other kind around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  many  people,  you  may  have  a  hard  time  maintaining  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive  mind-set  and  preventing  yourself  from  feeling  like  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure.  But  know  this:  It  is  possible  to  cultivate  a  positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude about yourself, no matter what circumstances you find</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself in or what kind of history you have. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SEVEN ABILITIES NEEDED TO FAIL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FORWARD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Here  are  seven  abilities  of  achievers  that  enable  them  to  fail, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not take it personally, and keep moving forward:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Achievers Reject Rejection</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Author  James  Allen  states,  "A  man  is  literally  what  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks,  his  character  being  the  complete  sum  of  all  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought." That's why it's important to make sure your thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">is on the right track. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  who  don't  give  up  keep  trying  because  they  don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">base their self-worth on their performance. Instead, they have</p>
<p class="calibre1">an internally based self-image. Rather than say, "I am a failure," </p>
<p class="calibre1">they say, "I missed that one," or "I made a mistake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist  Martin  E.  Seligman  believes  we  have  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">choices  when  we  fail:  We  can  internalize  or  externalize  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure. "People who blame themselves when they fail . . . think</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  are  worthless,  talentless,  unlovable,"  says  Seligman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"People  who  blame  external  events  do  not  lose  self-esteem</p>
<p class="calibre1">when bad events strike." <a href="index_split_003.html#p264">3</a>  To  keep  the  right  perspective,  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility  for  your  actions,  but  don't  take  failure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>personally. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Achievers See Failure As Temporary</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People  who  personalize  failure  see  a  problem  as  a  hole</p>
<p class="calibre1">they're  permanently  stuck  in.  But  achievers  see  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">predicament as temporary. For example, take the case of United</p>
<p class="calibre1">States President Harry S. Truman. In 1922, he was thirty-eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  old,  in  debt,  and  out  of  work.  In  1945,  he  was  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful leader of the free world, occupying the highest office</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the land. If he had seen failure as permanent, he would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained stuck and never would have kept trying and believing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">When achievers fail, they see it as a momentary event, not a lifelong epidemic. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Achievers See Failures As Isolated Incidents</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Author  Leo  Buscaglia  once  talked  about  his  admiration  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooking  expert  Julia  Child:  "I  just  love  her  attitude.  She  says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Tonight we're going to make a souffle!' And she beats this and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whisks that, and she drops things on the floor . . . and does all</p>
<p class="calibre1">these wonderful human things. Then she takes the souffle and</p>
<p class="calibre1">throws it in the oven and talks to you for a while. Finally, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">says,  'Now  it's  ready!'  But  when  she  opens  the  oven,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">souffle just falls flat as a pancake. But does she panic or burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">into tears? No! She smiles and says, 'Well, you can't win them</p>
<p class="calibre1">all. Bon appetit!'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When achievers fail, they see it as a momentary event, not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifelong  epidemic.  It's  not  personal.  If  you  want  to  succeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">don't let any single incident color your view of yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Achievers Keep Expectations Realistic</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>The  greater  the  feat  you  desire  to  achieve,  the  greater  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mental  preparation  required  for  overcoming  obstacles  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">persevering over the long haul. If you want to take a stroll in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your neighborhood, you can reasonably expect to have few, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">any,  problems.  But  that's  not  the  case  if  you  intend  to  climb</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mount Everest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  takes  time,  effort,  and  the  ability  to  overcome  setbacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You have to approach each day with reasonable expectations</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  not  get  your  feelings  hurt  when  everything  doesn't  turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">out perfectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something that happened on baseball's opening day in 1954</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrates  the  point  well.  The  Milwaukee  Braves  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cincinnati Reds played each other, and a rookie for each team</p>
<p class="calibre1">made his major-league debut during that game. The rookie who</p>
<p class="calibre1">played for the Reds hit four doubles and helped his team win</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a score of 9-8. The rookie for the Braves went 0 for 5. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reds player was Jim Greengrass, a name you probably haven't</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard.  The  other  guy,  who  didn't  get  a  hit,  might  be  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar  to  you.  His  name  was  Hank  Aaron,  the  player  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">became the best home-run hitter in the history of baseball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  Aaron's  expectations  for  that  first  game  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">unrealistic,  who  knows?  He  might  have  given  up  baseball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely he wasn't happy about his performance that day, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't think of himself as a failure. He had worked too hard for</p>
<p class="calibre1">too long. He wasn't about to give up easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">Achievers Focus on Strengths</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another way achievers keep themselves from personalizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure  is  by  focusing  on  their  strengths.  Bob  Butera,  former</p>
<p class="calibre1">president  of  the  New  Jersey  Devils  hockey  team,  was  asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  makes  a  winner.  He  answered,  "What  distinguishes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>winners from losers is that winners concentrate at all times on</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they  <i class="calibre4">can </i> do, not on what they can't do. If a guy is a great</p>
<p class="calibre1">shooter but not a great skater, we tell him to think only about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  shot,  the  shot,  the  shot—never  about  some  other  guy</p>
<p class="calibre1">outskating him. The idea is to remember your successes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  a  weakness  is  a  matter  of  character,  it  needs  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention. Focus on it until you shore it up. Otherwise, the best</p>
<p class="calibre1">bet  for  failing  forward  is  developing  and  maximizing  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengths. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">6. Achievers Vary Approaches to Achievement</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  <i class="calibre4">The Psychology of Achievement, </i> Brian Tracy writes about</p>
<p class="calibre1">four  millionaires  who  made  their  fortunes  by  age  thirty-five. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  involved  in  an  average  of  <i class="calibre4">seventeen </i> businesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  finding  the  one  that  took  them  to  the  top.  They  kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying  and  changing  until  they  found  something  that  worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Achievers are willing to vary their approaches to problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's  important  in  every  walk  of  life,  not  just  business.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  if  you're  a  fan  of  track-and-field  events,  you  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly  enjoyed  watching  athletes  compete  in  the  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump.  I'm  always  amazed  by  the  heights  achieved  by  the  men</p>
<p class="calibre1">and women in that event. What's really interesting is that in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1960s, the sport went through a major change in technique that</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed athletes to break the old records and push them up to</p>
<p class="calibre1">new levels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  person  responsible  for  that  change  was  Dick  Fosbury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where  previous  athletes  used  the  straddle  method  to  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump, in which they went over the bar while facing it, with one</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm and one leg leading, Fosbury developed a technique where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he went over headfirst with his back to the bar. It was dubbed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>the Fosbury Flop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Developing  a  new  high  jump  technique  was  one  thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting  it  accepted  by  others  was  another  matter.  Fosbury</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked, "I was told over and over again that I would never be</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful,  that  I  was  not  going  to  be  competitive  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">technique  was  simply  not  going  to  work. All  I  could  do  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrug and say, 'We'll just have to see.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  people  did  see.  Fosbury  won  the  gold  medal  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mexico City Olympics in 1968, shattering the previous Olympic</p>
<p class="calibre1">record  and  setting  a  new  world  record  in  the  process.  Since</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, nearly all world-class high jumpers use his technique. To</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve  his  goals,  Fosbury  varied  his  approach  to  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumping, and he didn't allow others' comments to make him feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  <i class="calibre4">Achievers Bounce Back</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">All  achievers  have  in  common  the  ability  to  bounce  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">after  an  error,  mistake,  or  failure.  Psychologist  Simone</p>
<p class="calibre1">Caruthers  says,  "Life  is  a  series  of  outcomes.  Sometimes  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outcome  is  what  you  want.  Great.  Figure  out  what  you  did</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.  Sometimes  the  outcome  is  what  you  don't  want.  Great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure out what you did so you don't do it again." <a href="index_split_003.html#p264">4</a> That's the</p>
<p class="calibre1">key to bouncing back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Achievers  are  able  to  keep  moving  forward  no  matter  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens.  And  that's  made  possible  because  they  remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  failure  does  not  make  <i class="calibre4">them </i> failures.  No  one  should  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes  personally.  That's  the  way  to  take  yourself  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ONE WHO REFUSED TO BE A FAILURE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>One of the best stories Fve ever heard of someone who refused</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take failure personally is that of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kid  who  desperately  wanted  to  play  football  for  Notre  Dame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  may  have  seen  the  film  based  on  his  life  called  <i class="calibre4">Rudy. </i> It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a good movie, but his real story is even more remarkable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and compelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first of fourteen children in a poor working-class family, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy loved sports as a kid and believed that might be his ticket</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  of  Joliet,  Illinois.  In  high  school,  he  gave  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely to football, but his heart was much greater than his</p>
<p class="calibre1">physique. He was slow, and at five feet six inches tall and 190</p>
<p class="calibre1">pounds, he wasn't exactly built for the game. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">RUDY'S DREAM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  senior,  he  began  dreaming  about  attending  Notre  Dame</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  playing  football  there.  But  Rudy  faced  another  problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His grades showed less promise than his physique. "I finished</p>
<p class="calibre1">third in my class," he is fond of saying. "Not from the top, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the bottom." He was a D student. He graduated from high</p>
<p class="calibre1">school with a 1.77 grade point average. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the next several years, Rudy changed his focus from one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  to  another.  He  tried  attending  junior  college  for  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">semester  but  flunked  every  class.  He  went  to  work  for  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">years at the local Commonwealth Edison power plant in Joliet</p>
<p class="calibre1">—what he considered to be the ultimate deadend job. And he</p>
<p class="calibre1">even did a two-year hitch in the navy, which turned out to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning  point  for  him.  That's  where  he  discovered  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't dumb and that he could handle responsibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  his  military  service,  he  returned  to  Joliet  and  again</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>worked in the power plant. He was more determined than ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">to go to Notre Dame, despite the criticism of his family, friends, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  coworkers.  He  knew  he  was  not  a  failure,  and  he  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">find a way to go to South Bend. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAKING A MOVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  saw  the  movie,  then  you  know  that  Rudy  eventually</p>
<p class="calibre1">made it. He quit his job, moved to South Bend, and managed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get into Holy Cross College, a community college affiliated with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  university.  He  attended  the  college  for  <i class="calibre4">two  years </i> and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earned  a  4.0  average  every  semester  before  Notre  Dame</p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted  him.  He  entered  his  dream  school  at  age  twenty-six</p>
<p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">eight years </i> after graduating from high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  two  years  of  sports  eligibility  remaining,  he  went  out</p>
<p class="calibre1">for football. And he made the team as a scrub, one of the warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies they put in practice to keep the good players sharp. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy made the most of it. He worked hard, and after a year, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went  from  the  bottom  of  the  scrubs  all  the  way  up  to  sixth</p>
<p class="calibre1">string—the  top  of  the  scrubs.  His  last  year,  he  worked  hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. And in the final game of his final season, Rudy lived his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream by getting to play. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">RUDY'S LAST CHANCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  movie,  Rudy  Ruettiger  gets  in  for  only  one  play  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of the game, and he sacks the quarterback. But that's not</p>
<p class="calibre1">how it really happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>"In real life, I had two chances to get the quarterback," says</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy.  "The  first  play,  I  didn't  get  there  in  time.  I  was  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxious and didn't execute the play. I failed." But once again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy  didn't  let  his  failure  make  <i class="calibre4">h i m </i> a  failure.  He  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined to fail forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  knew  this  was  the  last  chance  I  would  ever  get,"  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">explains. "When they snapped the ball, I wasn't worried about</p>
<p class="calibre1">failing.  I'd  done  that  already,  and  I  knew  why  I  had  failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's how you eliminate that fear. You keep learning until you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  the  confidence  to  perform  when  you  have  to  .  .  .  When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  snapped  the  ball  for  the  last  time,  I  put  the  moves  I'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">rehearsed  in  my  mind  on  the  guy  over  me  and  I  got  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarterback." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overjoyed,  the  team  carried  him  off  the  field  in  celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy says it's the only time that's happened to a player in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">history of Notre Dame football. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today Rudy is a motivational speaker. And believe it or not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  was  the  force  behind  the  making  of  the  movie  <i class="calibre4">Ru d y. </i> Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, it wasn't easy for him. It took him six years to see that</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen.  (Two  years  less  than  it  took  him  to  get  to  Notre</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dame!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The people in Hollywood told him, "You're not Paul Horning</p>
<p class="calibre1">or Joe Montana." Rudy agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's only one of them," he explained. "There's a million</p>
<p class="calibre1">of me." <a href="index_split_003.html#p264">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">And  that's  the  great  thing  about  Rudy's  story.  He  doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">have the athletic ability of Michael Jordan. Nor is he a genius</p>
<p class="calibre1">like Mozart, Van Gogh, Edison, or Einstein. He's just a regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">person—like  you  and  me.  The  only  reason  he's  an  achiever</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead of average is that he refused to let failure get the better</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>of  him.  He  learned  that  no  matter  how  many  times  you  fail,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn't have to make you a failure. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">J</b>ust  about  everyone  has  heard  of  the  Wright  brothers,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bicycle  mechanics  who  pioneered  manned  motorized  flight  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  first  part  of  the  twentieth  century.  The  circumstances</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding  Orville  and  Wilbur  Wright's  first  flight  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">December  17,1903,  make  an  interesting  story.  (Its  certainly  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">story  that  illustrates  how  to  fail  forward.)  But  what  you  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">not know is that prior to that day, the Wrights, unknowns with</p>
<p class="calibre1">no university education, were not the leaders in aviation. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">were obscure at best, and another man was expected to put the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first airplane in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  name  was  Dr.  Samuel  P.  Langley.  He  was  a  respected</p>
<p class="calibre1">former  professor  of  mathematics  and  astronomy  who  at  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  was  the  director  of  the  Smithsonian  Institution.  Langley</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  an  accomplished  thinker,  scientist,  and  inventor.  He  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">published  several  important  works  on  aerodynamics,  and  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessed a vision for achieving manned flight. In fact, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mid-to late 1890s, he had done extensive experiments with large</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmanned  plane  models  and  had  achieved  a  high  degree  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a><b class="calibre3">COMMISSIONED TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SUCCEED</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1898,  Langley  approached  the  U.S.  War  Department  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">funding  to  design  and  build  an  airplane  to  carry  a  man  aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  department  gave  him  a  commission  of  $50,000—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge sum at that time. Langley went right to work. By 1901, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  successfully  tested  an  unmanned  gasoline-powered</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavier-than-air craft: It was the first in history. And when he</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlisted  the  aid  of  Charles  Manley,  an  engineer  who  built  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful  new  lightweight  engine  based  on  the  designs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen Balzar, his success seemed inevitable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  8,  1903,  Langley  expected  his  years  of  work  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come  to  fruition.  As  journalists  and  curious  onlookers</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched,  Charles  Manley,  wearing  a  cork-lined  jacket,  strode</p>
<p class="calibre1">across the deck of a modified houseboat and climbed into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot's  seat  of  a  craft  called  the  <i class="calibre4">Great  Aerodrome. </i> The  full-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sized,  motorized  device  was  perched  atop  a  specially  built</p>
<p class="calibre1">catapult designed to initiate the  <i class="calibre4">Aerodrome's </i> flight into the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  when  they  attempted  the  launch,  part  of  the  <i class="calibre4">Aerodrome</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">got caught, and the biplane was flung into sixteen feet of water</p>
<p class="calibre1">a mere fifty yards away from the boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Criticism of Langley was brutal. For example, read this report</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the  <i class="calibre4">New York  Times:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ridiculous  fiasco  which  attended  the  attempt  at  aerial  navigation  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Langley  flying  machine  was  not  unexpected.  The  flying  machine</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  will  really  fly  might  be  evolved  by  the  combined  and  continuous</p>
<p class="calibre1">efforts  of  mathematicians  and  mechanicians  <i class="calibre4">[si c] </i> in  from  one  to  ten</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>million  years  .  .  .  No  doubt  the  problem  has  its  attractions  for  those  it interests,  but  to  ordinary  men,  it  would  seem  as  if  the  effort  might  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed more profitably. <a href="index_split_003.html#p265">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IN THE FACE OF FAILURE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At  first,  Langley  didn't  let  that  failure  or  the  accompanying</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticism deter him. Eight weeks later in early December, he and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manley  were  ready  to  attempt  flight  again.  They  had  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous  modifications  to  the  <i class="calibre4">Aerodrome, </i> and  once  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manley  climbed  into  the  cockpit  from  the  houseboat's  deck, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready to make history. But as before, disaster struck. This time</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cable  supports  to  the  wings  snapped  as  the  plane  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">launched,  the  craft  caught  again  on  the  launch  rail,  and  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunged into the river upside down. Manley nearly died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again  the  criticism  was  fierce.  His  <i class="calibre4">Great  Aerodrome </i> was</p>
<p class="calibre1">called  "Langley's  Folly,"  and  Langley  himself  was  accused  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasting  public  funds.  The  <i class="calibre4">New  York   Times  </i> commented,  "We</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope  that  Prof.  Langley  will  not  put  his  substantial  greatness</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  a  scientist  in  further  peril  by  continuing  to  waste  his  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  money  involved,  in  further  airship  experiments." <a href="index_split_003.html#p265">2</a>He</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Langley  said  afterward,  "I  have  brought  to  a  close  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion  of  the  work  which  seemed  to  be  specially  mine.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstration  of  the  practicality  of  mechanical  flight.  For  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next stage, which is the commercial and practical development</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the idea, it is probable that the world may look to others." In</p>
<p class="calibre1">other words, Langley had given up. Defeated and demoralized, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  had  abandoned  his  decades-long  pursuit  of  flight  without</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>ever  having  seen  one  of  his  planes  piloted  to  success.  Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">days later, Orville and Wilbur Wright—uneducated, unknown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and unfunded—flew their plane "Flyer I" over the sand dunes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Two PERSPECTIVES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Author  J  .  I.  Packer  states,  "A  moment  of  conscious  triumph</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes  one  feel  that  after  this  nothing  will  really  matter;  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment of realized disaster makes one feel that this is the end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of everything. But neither feeling is realistic, for neither event</p>
<p class="calibre1">is really what it is felt to be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Wright brothers did not rest on their success. The rush</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  achievement  that  day  in  December  of  1903  did  not  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">them think they had arrived. They continued experimenting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">working,  and  eventually  the  public  acknowledged  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievements.  In  contrast,  Langley  let  his  moment  of  disaster</p>
<p class="calibre1">make him think it was the end. He abandoned his experiments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  years  later  he  suffered  a  stroke,  and  a  year  after  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">died. And today, while even young schoolchildren have heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Wright  brothers,  Langley  is  remembered  only  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">relatively few aviation buffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHEN FAILURE GETS YOU BY THE HEART</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">What  happened  in  the  life  of  Samuel  Langley  occurs  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives  of  too  many  people  today.  They  allow  failure  to  get  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better  of  them  emotionally,  and  it  stops  them  from  achieving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>their dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lets  face  it.  Failure  can  be  very  painful—sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">physically  and  more  often  emotionally.  Seeing  part  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision fall flat really hurts. And if people heap ridicule on top of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  hurt  feelings,  you  feel  even  worse.  <i class="calibre4">The  first  important</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">step in weathering failure is sure you k now that your failure</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">does  not  mak e </i> you  <i class="calibre4">a  failure. </i> But  there's  more  to  it  than  that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For many people the pain of failure leads to fear of failure. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">they become like the person who says, <b class="calibre3">"I</b>'m too old to cry, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  hurts  too  much  to  laugh."  That's  when  many  people  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck in the fear cycle. And if fear overcomes you, it's almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible to fail forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The first important step in weathering failure is learning not to personalize it. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A CYCLE YOU DON'T WANT TO RIDE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Take  a  look  at  what  typically  happens  to  someone  who  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable  to  overcome  the  fear  of  failure  and  gets  caught  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear cycle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior  negative  experiences  cause  the  person  to  develop  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear  of  failure  that  starts  the  cycle.  For  example,  let's  say</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone  experienced  failure  as  a  child  trying  to  sell  candy</p>
<p class="calibre1">door-to-door to raise money for school. Later as an adult, he is</p>
<p class="calibre1">put in a situation that seems similar, and fear strikes. Whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">he is a salesperson with a need to make calls on customers or a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pastor  with  a  mission  to  visit  people  in  their  homes,  that  old</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood  failure  may  generate  fear.  The  fear  of  rejection</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><img src="index-60_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">creates  inaction.  Because  the  person  doesn't  act,  he  doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">gain personal experience in that situation—which is the key to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning  and  overcoming  future  obstacles.  The  lack  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience breeds an inability to handle similar situations. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">that ultimately feeds and increases the fear. The longer the fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">remains  unchecked,  the  harder  a  person  has  to  work  to  break</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cycle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FEAR OF FAILURE STOPS FORWARD PROGRESS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  inaction  that  results  when  people  are  stuck  in  the  fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycle  takes  on  many  forms.  Here  are  the  three  most  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones I've observed:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Paralysis</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For  some  people,  fear  of  failure  brings  about  absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">paralysis.  They  stop  trying  to  do  anything  that  might  lead  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure.  President  Harry  S.  Truman  offered  this  opinion:  "The</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst  danger  we  face  is  the  danger  of  being  paralyzed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubts  and  fears.  This  danger  is  brought  on  by  those  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandon faith and sneer at hope. It is brought on by those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread  cynicism  and  distrust  and  try  to  blind  us  to  the  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance  to  do  good  for  all  mankind."  People  whose  fear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>paralyzes them give up any hope of moving forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Procrastination</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  people  maintain  the  hope  of  progress  but  never  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  to  following  through.  Someone  once  called</p>
<p class="calibre1">procrastination the fertilizer that makes difficulties grow. Victor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kiam  stated  it  even  more  strongly;  he  called  it  opportunity's</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural assassin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Procrastination  steals  a  person's  time,  productivity,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential. As . President John F. Kennedy said, "There are risks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and costs to a program of action, but they are far less than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-range  risks  and  costs  of  comfortable  inaction." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Procrastination is too high a price to pay for fear of failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3.Purposelessness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom  Peters,  coauthor  of  <i class="calibre4">In  Search  of  Excellence, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasizes  that  there's  nothing  more  useless  than  someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  comes  to  the  end  of  the  day  and  congratulates  himself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, "Well, I made it through the day without screwing up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  that's  what  many  people  who  fear  failure  do.  Rather  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursue  worthy  objectives,  they  avoid  the  pain  of  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes. And in the midst of that transition, they lose sight of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any sense of purpose that they might have once possessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  fear  of  failure  and  the  resulting  inactivity  compound,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">person  in  the  fear  cycle  exhibits  additional  negative  side</p>
<p class="calibre1">effects:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">• Self-pity. </i> He feels sorry for himself. And as time goes on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he takes less responsibility for his inactivity and starts</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking of himself as a victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">• Excuses. </i> A person can fall down many times, but he won't</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>be a failure until he says that somebody pushed him. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, the person who makes a mistake, then offers an</p>
<p class="calibre1">excuse for it, adds a second mistake to his first. A person</p>
<p class="calibre1">can break out of the fear cycle only by taking personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility for his inaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">• Misused energy. </i> Constant fear divides the mind and</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes a person to lose focus. If he is going in too many</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions at once, he doesn't get anywhere. It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparable to stomping the gas pedal of a car that's in</p>
<p class="calibre1">neutral. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">• Hopelessness. </i> If allowed to run their course, continual fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">and inaction rob a person of hope. And poet Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wadsworth Longfellow described the situation in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">way: "The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun. The brightness of our life is gone." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BREAKING THE CYCLE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">People who want to get out of the fear cycle often spend time</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling  guilty  for  their  inability  to  change.  But  one  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons they are stuck in the fear cycle is that they focus their</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy  on  the  wrong  part  of  the  cycle.  Since  they  know  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear  got  the  cycle  going,  they  believe  that  they  have  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">eliminate it to break the cycle. Yet most people are unable to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.  You  can't  avoid  fear.  No  magic  potion  will  take  it  away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  you  can't  wait  for  motivation  to  get  you  going.  To</p>
<p class="calibre1">conquer fear, you have to feel the fear and take action anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>Several years ago while I was sitting in my doctor's waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,  I  came  across  a  few  paragraphs  in  a  medical  magazine</p>
<p class="calibre1">that describe the battle to act:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We hear it almost every day: sigh, sigh, sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  just  can't  get  myself  motivated  to  .  .  .  [lose  weight,  test  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood sugar, etc.]. And we hear an equal number of sighs from</p>
<p class="calibre1">diabetes educators who can't get their patients motivated to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">the right things for their diabetes and health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have news for you. Motivation is not going to strike you</p>
<p class="calibre1">like lightning. And motivation is not something that someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">else—nurse,  doctor,  family  member—can  bestow  or  force  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">you. The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ju s t  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">do  it. </b></i> Exercise,  lose  weight,  test  your  blood  sugar,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever. Do it without motivation and then guess what. After</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  start  doing  the  thing,  that's  when  the  motivation  comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Motivation is like love and happiness. It's a by-product. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">you're actively engaged in doing something, it sneaks up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">zaps you when you least expect it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Harvard  psychologist  Jerome  Bruner  says,  "You're  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely to act yourself into feeling than feel yourself into action." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So act! Whatever it is you know you should do, do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GET MOVING, BUILD MOMENTUM, </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAKE MISTAKES, MOVE ON</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Playwright  George  Bernard  Shaw  asserted,  "A  life  spent  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>making  mistakes  is  not  only  more  honorable  but  more  useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">than a life spent doing nothing." To overcome fear and break</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cycle,  you  have  to  be  willing  to  recognize  that  you  will</p>
<p class="calibre1">spend much of your life making mistakes. The bad news is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">if you've been inactive for a long time, getting started is hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do. The good news is that as soon as you start moving, it gets</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  can  take  action  and  keep  making  mistakes,  you  gain</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience.  (That's  why  President  Theodore  Roosevelt  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He  who  makes  no  mistakes  makes  no  progress.")  That</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience eventually brings competence, and you make fewer</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes. As  a  result,  your  fear  becomes  less  paralyzing.  But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole cycle-breaking process starts with action. You must</p>
<p class="calibre1">act  your  way  into  feeling,  not  wait  for  positive  emotions  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry you forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">You're more likely to act yourself into feeling than feel yourself into action. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">—JEROME BRUNER</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An African parable captures the idea very well:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  morning  in Africa,  a  gazelle  wakes  up.  It  knows  that  it  must  run</p>
<p class="calibre1">faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning a lion wakes</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.  It  knows  that  it  must  outrun  the  slowest  gazelle  or  it  will  starve  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn't matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle: When the sun comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">up you had better be running. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have always had a hard time failing forward, then you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  to  get  yourself  moving.  It  doesn't  matter  what  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped  you  or  how  long  you  have  been  inactive.  The  only</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>way to break the cycle is to face your fear and take action, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though it may seem small or insignificant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">EVEN THE BEST GET STUCK SOMETIMES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  unsuccessful  people  get  stuck  in  the  fear  cycle.  But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same thing happens to high achievers. For example, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you look at the life of the composer George Frederick Handel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you see a successful person who found himself in a rut that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed desperately to break out of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handel  was  a  musical  prodigy.  Though  his  father  wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to study law, he gravitated to music at an early age. By age</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeen, he held the post of church organist at the cathedral</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Halle, his hometown. A year later, he became a violinist and</p>
<p class="calibre1">harpsichordist at the kaiser's opera house in Hamburg. By age</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-one,  he  was  a  keyboard  virtuoso.  When  he  turned  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">composing, he gained immediate fame and soon was appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kapellmeister  conductor  to  the  elector  of  Hanover  (later  King</p>
<p class="calibre1">George I of England). When he moved to England, his renown</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew. By the time he was forty, he was world famous. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A REVERSAL OF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FORTUNE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  Handel's  talent  and  fame,  he  faced  considerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversity. Competition with rival English composers was fierce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Audiences  were  fickle  and  sometimes  didn't  turn  out  for  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">performances.  And  he  was  frequently  the  victim  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing  political  winds  of  the  times.  Several  times  he  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself penniless and on the verge of bankruptcy. The pain of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejection  and  failure  was  difficult  to  bear,  especially  following</p>
<p class="calibre1">his previous success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  his  problems  were  compounded  by  failing  health.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered  a  seizure  or  stroke,  which  left  his  right  arm  limp  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused  him  to  lose  the  use  of  four  fingers  on  his  right  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  he  recovered,  he  remained  despondent.  In  1741, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handel decided that it was time to retire, even though he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  fifty-six.  He  was  discouraged,  miserable,  and  consumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with debt. He felt certain he would land in debtors' prison. On</p>
<p class="calibre1">April  8,  he  gave  what  he  considered  his  farewell  concert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disappointed and filled with self-pity, he gave up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE INSPIRATION TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOVE FORWARD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But in August of that year, something incredible happened. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy  friend  named  Charles  Jennings  visited  Handel  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave  him  a  libretto  based  on  the  life  of  Christ.  The  work</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrigued  Handel—enough  to  stir  him  to  action.  He  began</p>
<p class="calibre1">writing. And immediately the floodgates of inspiration opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  him.  His  cycle  of  inactivity  was  broken.  For  twenty-one</p>
<p class="calibre1">days,  he  wrote  almost  nonstop.  Then  he  spent  another  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">days creating the orchestrations. In twenty-four days, he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">completed  the  260-page  manuscript.  He  called  the  piece</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a> <i class="calibre4">Messiah. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,  Handel's   <i class="calibre4">Messiah </i> is  considered  a  masterpiece  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  culmination  of  the  composer's  work.  In  fact,  Sir  Newman</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flower,  one  of  Handel's  biographers,  said  of  the  writing  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Messiah, </i>"Considering  the  immensity  of  the  work,  and  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">written about an experiment that was conducted with a group</p>
<p class="calibre1">of monkeys. It is a vivid story of failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four monkeys were placed in a room that had a tall pole in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the center. Suspended from the top of that pole was a bunch of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bananas. One of the hungry monkeys started climbing the pole</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  get  something  to  eat,  but  just  as  he  reached  out  to  grab  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">banana, he was doused with a torrent of cold water. Squealing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  scampered  down  the  pole  and  abandoned  his  attempt  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">feed  himself.  Each  monkey  made  a  similar  attempt,  and  each</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  was  drenched  with  cold  water.  After  making  several</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts, they finally gave up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  researchers  removed  one  of  the  monkeys  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room and replaced him with a new monkey. As the newcomer</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to climb the pole, the other three grabbed him and pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">him down to the ground. After trying to climb the pole several</p>
<p class="calibre1">times  and  being  dragged  down  by  the  others,  he  finally  gave</p>

<p class="calibre1">monkeys  in  the  experiment—meaning  you  can't  seem  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve what you desire but you don't know why—then take a</p>
<p class="calibre1">look at the pattern many failure-prone people fall into and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimate solution. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IT ALL STARTS WITH A  <i class="calibre4">MESS UP</i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1">What  starts  people  down  the  failure  freeway  is  a  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistake, failure, or mess up. But people who stay on the failure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>freeway don't think that it's their fault. They are similar to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drivers  who  wrote  the  following  explanations  for  the  auto</p>
<p class="calibre1">accidents in which they were involved:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• "As I reached an intersection, a hedge sprang up, obscuring</p>
<p class="calibre1">my vision." </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  "An  invisible  car  came  out  of  nowhere,  struck  my  car,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished." </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  "The  telephone  pole  was  approaching  fast.  I  attempted  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">swerve out of its path when it struck my front end." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "The indirect cause of this accident was a little guy in a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">car with a big mouth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "I had been driving my car for four years when I fell asleep at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wheel and had an accident." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "I was on the way to the doctors with rear-end trouble when</p>
<p class="calibre1">my  universal  joint  gave  way,  causing  me  to  have  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pedestrian." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "I was coming home, pulled into the wrong driveway, and hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">a tree I did not have." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "I was just keeping up with the cars behind me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run, so I ran</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>over him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "The guy was all over the road, and I had to swerve a number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of times before hitting him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">• "I pulled away at the side of the road, glanced at my mother-</p>
<p class="calibre1">in-law, and headed over the embankment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  people  on  the  failure  freeway  make  mistakes  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse  to  admit  them.  They  see  every  obstacle  or  error  as</p>
