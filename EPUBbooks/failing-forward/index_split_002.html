  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">the  selfishness  of  professional  athletes.  The  recent  criticism</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  been  especially  harsh  toward  pro  basketball  players</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the feeling is that too many players possess a me-first</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentality.  Critics  often  point  to  the  difference  in  performance</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  the  men's  and  the  women's  basketball  teams  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1996  Olympics.  The  amount  of  talent  on  the  men's  team  far</p>
<p class="calibre1">outweighed that of their opponents, yet the players sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">found  it  difficult  to  play  together  as  a  team.  Meanwhile,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">women virtually defined teamwork with their performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  competition  is  fierce,  selfishness  makes  it  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible  for  a  team  to  win.  It  ultimately  produces  failure.  If</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent alone won championships, then the Los Angeles Lakers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the late 1990s would have earned one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately  all  of  the  stories  out  of  the  NBA  aren't  about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>selfishness  and  failure.  The  1999  NBA  champions—the  San</p>
<p class="calibre1">Antonio  Spurs—won  their  victory  because  the  man  who  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  their  best  player  for  a  decade  knew  the  importance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting over himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing  at  seven  feet  one  inch,  David  Robinson  is  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">center for the Spurs. In his ten years in the NBA, Robinson has</p>
<p class="calibre1">earned  just  about  every  type  of  award  there  is  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">professional  basketball  player:  Rookie  of  the  Year  (1990), </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebounding  Champion  (1991),  Defensive  Player  of  the  Year</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1992),  #1  Shot  Blocker  (1992),  #1  Scorer  (1994),  and  Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">Valuable  Player  (1995).  He  has  also  been  named  to  the  NBA</p>
<p class="calibre1">All-Star  team  eight  times.  His  consistently  excellent  play  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">put  him  in  the  upper  echelon  statistically  in  several  all-time</p>
<p class="calibre1">NBA  categories,  including  points  scored  per  game.  He  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been named one of the fifty greatest players in NBA history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  all  of  Robinson's  personal  achievements,  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">never won an NBA championship—until the 1999 season. How</p>
<p class="calibre1">did  he  do  it?  By  giving  up  the  ball  offensively  and  allowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">another player, Tim Duncan, to be the hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  1999  play-offs,  teammate  Avery  Johnson</p>
<p class="calibre1">commented, "What we have in David Robinson is the ultimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">team  player,  the  ultimate  winner.  He  threw  his  ego  out  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">became a totally different player for the good of the team. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">could still average 25 points. But would we be where we are? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1999, Robinson put up the lowest averages of his career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His viewpoint was this: "I looked at our team and realized we</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  me  to  be  more  defensive  and  rebounding-minded.  To</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  a  complete  team,  both  of  us  didn't  need  to  score.  Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">nights I might, but it's Tim's team. And I'm fine with that." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>The  result  of  Robinson's  unselfish  ability  to  put  the  team</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead of himself was success for  <i class="calibre4">everyone </i> on the team. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want  to  win  and  overcome  failure,  you've  got  to  get  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">START ADDING VALUE TO OTHERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CONTINUALLY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When people think about you, do they say to themselves, "My</p>
<p class="calibre1">life  is  better  because  of  that  person,"  or  "My  life  is  worse"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their response probably answers the question of whether you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  adding  value  to  them.  Since  we  moved  to Atlanta  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  ago,  we've  made  some  new  friends  named  Howard  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doris Bowen. Not long ago, my wife, Margaret, and I attended</p>
<p class="calibre1">a birthday party for Doris. A lot of people attended that party</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of the positive impact she's had on their lives. As we</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat  listening,  person  after  person  stood  up  to  talk  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference she had made in his or her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doris  is  an  extra-mile  person. After  I  had  a  heart  attack  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1998,  there  came  a  time  when  I  had  to  go  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital  all  day  for  tests.  Doris  dropped  everything  to  spend</p>
<p class="calibre1">that nerve-racking day with Margaret, even though we'd only</p>
<p class="calibre1">just met her. Doris is always doing that kind of thing for others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She's a wonderful friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all of the people at the party told Doris how much she</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant to them, she stood up and said, "All my life I've wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">people to feel like they were better for knowing me. Thank you</p>
<p class="calibre1">for making me feel like I've made a difference." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  succeed  personally,  you  must  try  to  help  others.  That's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>why my friend Zig Ziglar says, "You can get everything in life</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  want  if  you  help  enough  other  people  get  what  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">want."  How  do  you  do  that?  How  can  you  turn  your  focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">from yourself and start adding value to others? You can do it</p>
<p class="calibre1">by . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Putting Others First in Your Think ing</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  you  meet  people,  is  your  first  thought  about  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they'll  think  of  you  or  how  you  can  make  them  feel  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable? At  work,  do  you  try  to  make  your  coworkers  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees look good, or are you more concerned about making</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  that  you  receive  your  share  of  the  credit?  When  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">interact with family members, whose best interests do you have</p>
<p class="calibre1">in mind? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">When you know people's values, you can add value to them. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Your  answers  show  where  your  heart  is.  To  add  value  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">others,  you  need  to  start  putting  others  ahead  of  yourself  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your mind and heart. If you can do it there, you will be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">put them first in your actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Finding Out What Others Need</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">How  can  anyone  add  value  to  others  if  he  doesn't  know</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">what </i> they care about? Listen to people. Ask them what matters</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  them. And  observe  them.  If  you  can  discover  how  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">spend their time and money, you'll know what they value. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you know people's values, you can add value to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Meeting That Need with Excellence and Generosity</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The final step requires concrete action. Once you know what</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters  to  people,  do  your  best  to  meet  their  needs  with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>excellence  and  generosity.  Offer  your  best  with  no  thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward what you might receive in return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">President  Calvin  Coolidge  believed  that  "no  enterprise  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it performs</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  great  service,  not  for  itself,  but  for  others;  or  failing</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEHIND EVERY GREAT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  think  of  some  of  the  notable  figures  in  history  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  able  to  minister  to  people's  needs  and  perform  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">service, one of the first who comes to mind is John Wesley, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighteenth-century  Briton  who  founded  the  Methodist</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement.  He  was  a  leader  who  served  God  unselfishly  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  life.  But  I  consider  someone  else  in  his  family  to  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been more selfless than he was and, in fact, to have made his</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievements possible through her service. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">No enterprise can exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">performs some great service, not for itself, but for others; or failing therein it</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—CALVIN COOLIDGE</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That  person  was  Johns  mother,  Susanna  Wesley.  Born  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-fourth  child  of  a  well-to-do  family  in  London  in  1669, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  highly  intelligent  Susanna  was  the  "pet"  of  her  father, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>clergyman  Samuel  Annesley.  Though  daughters  were  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">usually  given  formal  education  in  England  at  that  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Susanna received excellent instruction from her father and was</p>
<p class="calibre1">also allowed to be in his study when the many famous men of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  time  congregated  there  to  debate  current  issues  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophy.  As  a  result,  she  was  well  informed,  and  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">intellect was razor sharp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  age  nineteen,  she  married  Samuel  Wesley,  a  young</p>
<p class="calibre1">clergyman  who  came  to  be  regarded  as  one  of  the  finest</p>
<p class="calibre1">scholars of his day. They set up household and began their life</p>
<p class="calibre1">together. Before long, Susanna bore their first child, and then</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  more  followed.  Unfortunately  their  hopes  were  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">than their prospects, and they spent their nearly fifty years of</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage barely scraping by financially. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">INFLUENCING THE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">INFLUENCERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  those  days,  middle-class  women  didn't  work  outside  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">home, but Susanna had a more-than-full-time job nonetheless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She dedicated herself selflessly to caring for her family. She ran</p>
<p class="calibre1">the household, managed the finances (her husband was a poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">money  manager),  and  oversaw  their  modest  farming  efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when Samuel landed in debtors' prison at Lincoln Castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  three  months,  she  persevered.  And  she  did  that  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuing to have numerous children, which was not unusual</p>
<p class="calibre1">in those days. Over the course of twenty-one years, she gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">birth to  <i class="calibre4">nineteen </i> children, ten of whom survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Despite all the work that Susanna Wesley performed for her</p>
<p class="calibre1">family, her most important task was to educate her children. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">six hours every day (except Sunday), she dedicated herself to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  moral  and  intellectual  instruction  of  her  three  sons  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seven daughters. She made it the object of her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she was in her sixties, her son John asked her to share</p>
<p class="calibre1">her methods by writing them down. Her reply:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  writing  anything  about  my  way  of  education  I  am  much  averse  to.  It</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot,  I  think,  be  of  service  to  anyone  to  know  how  I,  who  have  lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">such  a  retired  life  for  so  many  years,  used  to  employ  my  time  and  care  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing  up  my  children.  No  one  can,  without  renouncing  the  world,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  most  literal  sense,  observe  my  method;  and  there  are  few,  if  any,  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  entirely  devote  above  twenty  years  of  the  prime  of  life  in  hopes  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">save the souls of their children, which they think may be saved without so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much ado; for that was my principal intention. <a href="index_split_003.html#p270">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  performed  an  incredibly  selfless  act,  and  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">process, she had given up a lot—as she said, twenty years of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  prime.  But  the  results  found  in  her  children  speak  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves. Charles was an influential clergyman and has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">called one of the greatest hymn writers of all time. And John is</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  by  many  to  have  shaped  England  more  than  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  person  of  his  generation.  His  impact  on  Protestant</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity is still quite remarkable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  may  not  be  able  to  give  your  family  the  time  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Susanna  Wesley  gave  to  hers.  But  what  matters  is  that  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">give  all  you  <i class="calibre4">can </i> to the people who are important to you. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can do that only if you learn to get over yourself. Be more</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned  with  what  you  can  give  rather  than  what  you  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">get because giving truly is the highest level of living. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a> <i class="calibre4">Your Ninth Step to Failing Forward:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Get Over Yourself and Start Giving Yourself</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  a  selfish  streak  has  been  keeping  you  from  getting  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself, examine your attitude, and determine to make meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  needs  of  others  a  priority  in  your  life.  You  can  start  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking  yourself  the  following  questions  daily,  either  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning or at the end of each day:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Whom am I pouring my life into? </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Whom am I helping who cannot help me in return? </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Whom am I lifting who can't help himself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Whom am I encouraging daily? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you will act with the interest of others in mind every day, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  will  soon  be  able  to  give  concrete,  affirming  answers  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">these questions. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—ELBERT HUBBARD</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">W</b>orking artists David Bayles and Ted Orland tell a story about</p>
<p class="calibre1">an art teacher who did an experiment with his grading system</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  two  groups  of  students.  It  is  a  parable  on  the  benefits  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure. Here is what happened:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ceramics  teacher  announced  on  opening  day  that  he  was  dividing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">class  into  two  groups. All  those  on  the  left  side  of  the  studio,  he  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  graded  solely  on  the  <i class="calibre4">quantity </i> of  work  they  produced,  all  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  right  solely  on  its  <i class="calibre4">quality. </i> His  procedure  was  simple:  on  the  final</p>
<p class="calibre1">day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  "quantity"  group:  fifty  pounds  of  pots  rated  an  "A,"  forty  pounds  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"B,"  and  so  on.  Those  being  graded  on  "quality,"  however,  needed  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce  only  one  pot—albeit  a  perfect  one—to  get  an  "A."  Well,  came</p>
<p class="calibre1">grading  time  and  a  curious  fact  emerged:  the  works  of  the  highest  quality</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  all  produced  by  the  group  being  graded  for  quantity.  It  seems  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">while  the  "quantity"  group  was  busily  churning  out  piles  of  work—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning from their mistakes—the "quality" group had sat theorizing about</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection,  and  in  the  end  had  little  more  to  show  for  their  efforts  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. <a href="index_split_003.html#p271">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It  doesn't  matter  whether  your  objectives  are  in  the  area  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">art,  business,  ministry,  sports,  or  relationships.  The  only  way</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can get ahead is to fail early, fail often, and fail forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a><b class="calibre3">TAKE THE JOURNEY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  teach  leadership  to  thousands  of  people  each  year  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous  conferences.  And  one  of  my  deepest  concerns  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">always  that  some  people  will  go  home  from  the  event  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing will change in their lives. They enjoy the "show" but</p>
<p class="calibre1">fail  to  implement  any  of  the  ideas  presented  to  them.  I  tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  continually:  We  overestimate  the  event  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">underestimate  the  process.  Every  fulfilled  dream  occurred</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of dedication to a process. (That's one of the reasons I</p>
<p class="calibre1">write  books  and  create  programs  on  audiocassette—so  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">people can engage in the ongoing  <i class="calibre4">process </i> of growth.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">We overestimate the event and underestimate the process. Every fulfilled dream</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">occurred because of dedication to a process. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People  naturally  tend  toward  inertia.  That's  why  self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">improvement is such a struggle. But that's also why adversity</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies at the heart of every success. The process of achievement</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes  through  repeated  failures  and  the  constant  struggle  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">climb to a higher level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people will grudgingly concede that they must make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  some  adversity  in  order  to  succeed.  They'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledge  that  they  have  to  experience  the  occasional</p>
<p class="calibre1">setback  to  make  progress.  But  I  believe  that  success  comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">only if you take that thought one step farther. To achieve your</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreams, you must  <i class="calibre4">embrace </i> adversity and make failure a regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of your life. If you're not failing, you're probably not really</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a><b class="calibre3">THE BENEFITS OF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ADVERSITY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist  Dr.  Joyce  Brothers  asserts,  "The  person</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitable part of the process of getting to the top." Adversity</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the failure that often results from it should be expected in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  process  of  succeeding,  and  they  should  be  viewed  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely critical parts of it. In fact, the benefits of adversity</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  many.  Consider  these  reasons  to  embrace  adversity  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">persevere through it:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Adversity Creates Resilience</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing in life breeds resilience like adversity and failure. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">study  in  <i class="calibre4">Ti m e </i> magazine  in  the  mid-1980s  described  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredible  resilience  of  a  group  of  people  who  had  lost  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">jobs  three  times  because  of  plant  closings.  Psychologists</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected  them  to  be  discouraged,  but  they  were  surprisingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic. Their adversity had actually  created  an  advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  they  had  already  lost  a  job  and  found  a  new  one  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least  twice,  they  were  better  able  to  handle  adversity  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  who  had  worked  for  only  one  company  and  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves unemployed. <a href="index_split_003.html#p271">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">To achieve your dreams, you must embrace adversity and make failure a regular</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">forward. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a> <i class="calibre4">2. Adversity Develops Maturity</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Adversity  can  make  you  better  if  you  don't  let  it  make  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitter.  Why?  Because  it  promotes  wisdom  and  maturity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  playwright  William  Saroyan  spoke  to  this  issue:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good  people  are  good  because  they've  come  to  wisdom</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  failure.  We  get  very  little  wisdom  from  success,  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the world continues to change at a faster and faster rate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maturity with flexibility becomes increasingly important. These</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualities  come  from  weathering  difficulties.  Harvard  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">school professor John Kotter says, "I can imagine a group of</p>
<p class="calibre1">executives  20  years  ago  discussing  a  candidate  for  a  top  job</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  saying,  'This  guy  had  a  big  failure  when  he  was  32.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone  else  would  say,  'Yep,  yep,  that's  a  bad  sign.'  I  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine  that  same  group  considering  a  candidate  today  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying,  'What  worries  me  about  this  guy  is  that  he's  never</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed.'" <a href="index_split_003.html#p271">3</a>  The  problems  we  face  and  overcome  prepare  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearts for future difficulties. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Adversity Pushes the Envelope of Accepted Performance</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lloyd Ogilvie told of a friend who was a circus performer in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  youth.  The  fellow  described  learning  to  work  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapeze:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  you  know  that  the  net  below  will  catch  you,  you  stop  worrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  falling.  You  actually  learn  to  fall  successfully!  What  that  means  is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you can concentrate on catching the trapeze swinging toward you, and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  falling,  because  repeated  falls  in  the  past  have  convinced  you  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">net  is  strong  and  reliable  when  you  do  fall  .  .  .  The  result  of  falling  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">being  caught  by  the  net  is  a  mysterious  confidence  and  daring  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapeze. You fall less. Each fall makes you able to risk more. <a href="index_split_003.html#p271">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  a  person  learns  from  experience  that  he  can  live</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>through  adversity,  he  is  reluctant  to  buck  mindless  tradition, </p>
<p class="calibre1">push the envelope of organizational performance, or challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself to press his physical limits. Failure prompts a person to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rethink the status quo. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Adversity Provides Greater Opportunities</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  believe  that  eliminating  problems  limits  our  potential.  Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  every  successful  entrepreneur  I've  met  has  numerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">stories of adversity and setbacks that opened doors to greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity. For example, in 1978, Bernie Marcus, the son of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor  Russian  cabinetmaker  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  was  fired</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Handy  Dan,  a  do-it-yourself  hardware  retailer.  That</p>
<p class="calibre1">prompted Marcus to team with Arthur Blank to start their own</p>
<p class="calibre1">business.  In  1979,  they  opened  their  first  store  in  Atlanta, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Georgia.  It  was  called  The  Home  Depot.  Today,  The  Home</p>
<p class="calibre1">Depot has more than 760 stores employing more than 157,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">people,  the  business  has  expanded  to  include  overseas</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations, and each year the corporation does more than $30</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion in sales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm  sure  Bernie  Marcus  wasn't  very  happy  about  getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">fired  from  his  job  at  Handy  Dan.  But  if  he  hadn't  been,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows  whether  he  would  have  achieved  the  success  he  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">today. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">Adversity Prompts Innovation</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Early  in  the  twentieth  century,  a  boy  whose  family  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrated from Sweden to Illinois sent twenty-five cents to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">publisher  for  a  book  on  photography.  What  he  received</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead  was  a  book  on  ventriloquism.  What  did  he  do?  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">adapted and learned ventriloquism. The boy was Edgar Bergen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and for more than forty years he entertained audiences with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">help of a wooden dummy named Charlie McCarthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>The  ability  to  innovate  is  at  the  heart  of  creativity—a  vital</p>
<p class="calibre1">component  in  success.  University  of  Houston  professor  Jack</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matson  recognized  that  fact  and  developed  a  course  that  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">students  came  to  call  "Failure  101."  In  it,  Matson  assigns</p>
<p class="calibre1">students to build mock-ups of products that no one would ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">buy.  His  goal  is  to  get  students  to  equate  failure  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">innovation  instead  of  defeat.  That  way  they  will  free</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  to  try  new  things.  "They  learn  to  reload  and  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready to shoot again," says Matson. If you want to succeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  have  to  learn  to  make  adjustments  to  the  way  you  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">things and try again. Adversity helps to develop that ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6.  <i class="calibre4">Adversity Recaps Unexpected Benefits</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  average  person  makes  a  mistake  and  automatically</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks  that  it's  a  failure.  But  some  of  the  greatest  stories  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success can be found in the unexpected benefits of mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, most people are familiar with the story of Edison</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  phonograph:  He  discovered  it  while  trying  to  invent</p>
<p class="calibre1">something  entirely  different.  But  did  you  know  that  Kellogg's</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corn  Flakes  resulted  when  boiled  wheat  was  left  in  a  baking</p>
<p class="calibre1">pan overnight? Or that Ivory soap floats because a batch was</p>
<p class="calibre1">left in the mixer too long and had a large volume of air whipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">into it? Or that Scott Towels were launched when a toilet paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine put too many layers of tissue together? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horace  Walpole  said  that  "in  science,  what  happened  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">German-Swiss  chemist  experimenting  with  sulfuric  acid  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nitric  acid.  When  he  accidentally  spilled  Christian  Friedrich</p>
<p class="calibre1">SchÖnbein. One day he was working in the kitchen—which his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife  had  strictly  forbidden—and  was  some  of  the  mixture  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  kitchen  table,  he  thought  he  was  in  trouble.  (He  <i class="calibre4">k new </i> he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  experience  "adversity"  when  his  wife  found  out!)  He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>hurriedly snatched up a cotton apron, wiped up the mess, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung the apron by the fire to dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In science  <i class="calibre4">mistakes always precede the truth. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—HORACE WALPOLE</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly  there  was  a  violent  explosion.  Evidently  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cellulose  in  the  cotton  underwent  a  process  called  nitration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwittingly  SchÖnbein  had  invented  nitrocellulose—what</p>
<p class="calibre1">came to be called smokeless gunpowder or guncotton. He went</p>
<p class="calibre1">on to market his invention, which made him a lot of money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  <i class="calibre4">Adversity Motivates</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Years ago when Bear Bryant was coaching the University of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alabama's football team, the Crimson Tide was ahead by only</p>
<p class="calibre1">six points in a game with less than two minutes remaining in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourth quarter. Bryant sent his quarterback into the game with</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions to play it safe and run out the clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  huddle,  the  quarterback  said,  "Coach  says  to  play  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe,  but  that's  what  they're  expecting.  Let's  give  them  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise." And with that, he called a pass play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the quarterback dropped back and threw the pass, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">defending  cornerback,  who  was  a  champion  sprinter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">intercepted the ball and headed toward the end zone, expecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to score a touchdown. The quarterback, who was not known as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a good runner, took off after the cornerback and ran him down</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  behind,  tackling  him  on  the  5-yard  line.  His  effort  saved</p>
<p class="calibre1">the game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  clock  ran  out,  the  opposing  coach  approached</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bear  Bryant  and  said,  "What's  this  business  about  your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>quarterback  not  being  a  runner?  He  ran  down  my  speedster</p>
<p class="calibre1">from behind!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bryant  responded,  "Your  man  was  running  for  six  points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My man was running for his life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing can motivate a person like adversity. Olympic diver</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pat  McCormick  discusses  this  point:  "I  think  failure  is  one  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the great motivators. After my narrow loss in the 1948 trials, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew how really good I could be. It was the defeat that focused</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  my  concentration  on  my  training  and  goals."  McCormick</p>
<p class="calibre1">went on to win two gold medals in the Olympics in Helsinki in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1952 and another two in Melbourne four years later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you can step back from the negative circumstances facing</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, you will be able to discover their positive benefits. That is</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  always  true;  you  simply  have  to  be  willing  to  look  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them—and  not  take  the  adversity  you  are  experiencing  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">personally</p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  lose  your  job,  think  about  the  resilience  you're</p>
<p class="calibre1">developing. If you try something daring and survive, evaluate</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  you  learned  about  yourself—and  how  it  will  help  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">take on new challenges. If a bookstore gets your order wrong, </p>
<p class="calibre1">figure out whether it's an opportunity to learn a new skill. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">if  you  experience  a  train  wreck  in  your  career,  think  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">maturity  it's  developing  in  you.  Besides,  Bill  Vaughan</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintains that "in the game of life it's a good idea to have a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">early  losses,  which  relieves  you  of  the  pressure  of  trying  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintain an undefeated season." Always measure an obstacle</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to the size of the dream you're pursuing. It's all in how you</p>
<p class="calibre1">look at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a><b class="calibre3">WHAT COULD BE WORSE? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  most  incredible  stories  of  adversity  overcome  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">success gained is that of Joseph, who was an ancient Hebrew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You may be familiar with the story. He was born the eleventh of</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve  sons  in  a  wealthy  Middle  Eastern  family  whose  trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  raising  livestock.  As  a  teenager,  Joseph  alienated  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">brothers. First, he was his father's favorite, even though he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly the youngest. Second, he used to tell his father anytime</p>
<p class="calibre1">his brothers weren't doing their work properly with the sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And third, he made the mistake of telling his older brothers that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one day he would be in charge of them. Some of his brothers</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted to kill him, but the eldest, Reuben, prevented them from</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing that. So when Reuben wasn't around, the others sold him</p>
<p class="calibre1">into slavery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph  ended  up  in  Egypt  working  in  the  house  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">captain  of  the  guard,  a  man  named  Potiphar.  Because  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership and administrative skills, Joseph quickly rose in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ranks,  and  before  long,  he  was  running  the  entire  household. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was making the best of a bad situation. But then things got</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse.  The  wife  of  his  master  tried  to  persuade  him  to  sleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  her.  When  he  refused,  she  accused  <i class="calibre4">h i m </i> of  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">advances to  <i class="calibre4">her </i> and got Potiphar to throw Joseph in prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FROM SLAVERY TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PRISON</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>At that point, Joseph was in a really difficult position. He was</p>
<p class="calibre1">separated  from  his  family.  He  was  living  in  a  foreign  land.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a slave. And he was locked in prison. But again, he made</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  best  of  a  tough  situation.  Before  long,  the  warden  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prison  put  Joseph  in  charge  of  all  prisoners  and  the  prison's</p>
<p class="calibre1">daily activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph  met  a  fellow  prisoner  who  had  been  an  official  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pharaoh's court, the chief cupbearer. And Joseph was able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do him a favor by interpreting the man's dream. When he saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the official was grateful, Joseph made a request of him in</p>
<p class="calibre1">return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When all goes well with you," Joseph asked, "remember me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this prison. For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being</p>
<p class="calibre1">put in a dungeon." <a href="index_split_003.html#p271">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph  had  hope  a  few  days  later  when  the  official  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned  to  court  and  the  good  graces  of  the  monarch.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected any minute to receive word that Pharaoh was setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">him free. But he waited. And waited. Two   <i class="calibre4">years </i> passed before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cupbearer remembered Joseph, and he did so only because</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pharaoh wanted someone to interpret his dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FINALLY THE PAYOFF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  end,  Joseph  was  able  to  the  Hebrew  showed  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom, the Egyptian ruler put Joseph in charge of the entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">kingdom. As  the  result  of  Joseph's  leadership,  planning,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>system  of  food  storage,  when  famine  struck  the  Middle  East</p>
<p class="calibre1">seven  years  later,  many  thousands  of  people  who  otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have died were able to survive, including Joseph's own</p>
<p class="calibre1">family. When his brothers traveled to Egypt for relief from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">famine— <i class="calibre4">t w e n t y </i> years  after  selling  him  into  slavery—they</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  that  their  brother  Joseph  was  not  only  alive,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">second in command of the most powerful kingdom in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few people would welcome the adversity of thirteen years in</p>
<p class="calibre1">bondage  as  a  slave  and  prisoner.  But  as  far  as  we  know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph never gave up hope and never lost his perspective. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">did  he  hold  a  grudge  against  his  brothers. After  their  father</p>
<p class="calibre1">died,  he  told  them,  "You  intended  to  harm  me,  but  God</p>
<p class="calibre1">intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">saving  of  many  lives."  He  found  the  positive  benefits  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative experiences. And if he can do it, so can we. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">E</b>very era has its great explorers, people willing to face danger</p>
<p class="calibre1">to break new-ground and discover new worlds. Americans love</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  kinds  of  people.  The  names  of  pioneers  and  daring</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventurers  ring  throughout  our  history:  Columbus,  Crockett, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lewis and Clark, Lindbergh, Armstrong. The fuel that makes it</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible  for  people  like  them  to  conquer  new  territory  is  risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pioneer  aviator  Charles  Lindbergh  emphasized  that  point:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of man would live where there is no daring? I don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe  in  taking  foolish  chances,  but  nothing  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplished if we don't take any chances at all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Risk  is  a  funny  thing;  it's  very  subjective.  Here's  what  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean: Someone may have no trouble plunging off a high tower</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  bungee  cord  attached  to  his  leg,  but  the  same  person</p>
<p class="calibre1">may regard speaking in front of a group of twenty people as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">death-defying  risk.  To  another  person,  speaking  isn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">intimidating at all. For example, I love to speak to groups, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've spoken to groups as large as eighty-two thousand people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, I would never willingly bungee jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How do you judge whether some activity is worth the risk? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you base it on your fear? No, you should do some things</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  scare  you.  Should  you  base  it  on  the  probability  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>success?  No,  I  don't  think  that's  the  answer  either.  Risk  must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  evaluated  not  by  the  fear  it  generates  in  you  or  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">probability of your success, but by the  <i class="calibre4">value </i> of the goal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">envelope of risk in order to achieve goals that were valuable to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. As she grew up, there were no significant indications that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Millie  would  someday  be  one  of  the  great  adventurers  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century. She was an inquisitive child, born in Kansas</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  1897.  She  was  bright  and  excelled  academically.  She  liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading  books  and  reciting  poetry.  She  also  enjoyed  sports, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly basketball and tennis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  recognizing  the  impact  of  war  on  the  soldiers  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">served  in  Europe  during  World  War  I,  Millie  wanted  to  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">something  to  help.  She  decided  to  study  nursing,  and  during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the war, she worked as a military nurse's aide in Canada. After</p>
<p class="calibre1">the war was over, she enrolled as a premed student at Columbia</p>
<p class="calibre1">University  in  New  York.  In  1920,  after  her  first  year  at  school</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  finished,  she  visited  her  family  in  Los  Angeles.  That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">when she took her first plane ride at Daugherty Field in Long</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beach, California. And she was hooked."As soon as we left the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground  I  knew  I  myself  had  to  fly,"  she  said. <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">1</a>  She  never</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned to med school. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a><b class="calibre3">BOLD VENTURES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That  was  the  beginning  of  a  new  life  for  Millie.  Oh,  I  should</p>
<p class="calibre1">mention  that  "Millie"  is  what  her  family  called  her.  You  and  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know her as Amelia— Amelia Earhart. She immediately began</p>
<p class="calibre1">working  odd  jobs  to  earn  the  $1,000  required  to  take  flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons,  and  soon  she  was  learning  how  to  fly  from  Anita</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snook, another pioneer flier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning to fly wasn't easy—at least not for Earhart. She had</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than her share of crashes. But she persevered. Years later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she told her husband her perspective on flying: "Please know I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am quite aware of the hazards... I want to do it because I want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others." <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1921, Earhart made her first solo flight. The next year she</p>
<p class="calibre1">set the first of her many aviation records (for highest altitude). </p>
<p class="calibre1">She piloted planes because she loved to fly, but she also had</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  agenda.  She  was  trying  to  break  ground  for  others.  "My</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambition is to have this wonderful gift produce practical results</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the future of commercial flying and for the women who may</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to fly tomorrow's planes," she said. <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  course  of  her  flying  career,  Earhart  set  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">records and achieved many firsts:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• 1928: First woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an aircraft as</p>
<p class="calibre1">passenger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  1929:  First  president  of  the  Ninety-nines,  an  association  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">female pilots. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>•  1930:  Women's  speed  record  of  181.8  miles  per  hour  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">three-kilometer course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  1931:  First  person  to  set  an  altitude  record  in  an  autogiro</p>
<p class="calibre1">(early helicopter) at 18,451 feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• 1932: First female pilot to fly solo over the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• 1935: First person to fly solo and nonstop between Oakland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">California, and Honolulu, Hawaii. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ONE MORE BIG RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By 1935, Amelia Earhart was a seasoned, world-class pilot and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  done  a  lot  to  accomplish  her  goals  of  opening  doors  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">women  and  legitimizing  commercial  aviation.  She  must  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed  the  motto  of  all  great  achievers,  "If  at  first  you  <i class="calibre4">do</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed,  try  something  harder,"  because  that's  when  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided to embark on her greatest adventure. She intended to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fly around the world. That feat had already been accomplished</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  a  man,  but  Earhart  intended  to  route  her  flight  near  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">equator  and  set  a  record  for  the  longest  flight  (by  either</p>
<p class="calibre1">gender) at 29,000 miles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In March 1935, she started on her way. She flew the first leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Oakland  to  Hawaii.  But  as  she  took  off  from  Luke  Field</p>
<p class="calibre1">near  Pearl  Harbor,  she  blew  a  tire  and  crashed  the  plane, </p>
<p class="calibre1">causing  tremendous  damage.  She  had  failed—but  she  wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  to  give  up.  Her  plane  was  shipped  to  California  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairs, and she planned her next attempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>Two  years  later,  in  June  1937,  Earhart  again  started  on  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">around-the-world  voyage,  this  time  heading  east.  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">observed,  "I  have  a  feeling  that  there  is  just  about  one  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">good flight left in my system and I hope this trip is it. Anyway</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I have finished this job, I mean to give up long-distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">'stunt'  flying." <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">4</a>  By  the  end  of  June,  she  and  her  navigator, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frederick Noonan, had flown 22,000 miles. When they took off</p>
<p class="calibre1">from New Guinea on July 2, they were filled with hope because</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  were  only  7,000  miles  to  go.  But  they  were  never  seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. Although U.S. Navy ships searched diligently, no trace</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them or their plane was found. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WORTH THE RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If anyone had been able to talk to Earhart during her last hours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  believe  she  would  not  have  expressed  any  regret  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempting what she did. She once said, "Now and then women</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  do  for  themselves  what  men  have  already  done—</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasionally  what  men  have  not  done—thereby  establishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves as persons, and perhaps encouraging other women</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  greater  independence  of  thought  and  action.  Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">such consideration was a contributing reason for my wanting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do what I so much wanted to do." <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">To  achieve  any  worthy  goal,  you  must  take  risks.  Amelia</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earhart believed that, and her advice when it came to risk was</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple and direct: "Decide whether or not the goal is worth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">risks involved. If it is, stop worrying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reality  is  that  <i class="calibre4">everything </i> in life is risky. If  you  want  to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>avoid all risk, then don't do any of the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't ride in an automobile—they cause 20 percent of all fatal</p>
<p class="calibre1">accidents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't  travel  by  air,  rail,  or  water—16  percent  of  all  accidents</p>
<p class="calibre1">result from these activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't  walk  in  the  street—15  percent  of  all  accidents  occur</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't stay at home—17 percent of all accidents happen there. <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  life,  there  are  no  safe  places  or  risk-free  activities.  Helen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Keller,  author,  speaker,  and  advocate  for  disabled  persons, </p>
<p class="calibre1">asserted,"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature,  nor  do  the  children  of  men  as  a  whole  experience  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avoiding  danger  is  no  safer  in  the  long  run  than  outright</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything in life brings risk. It's true that you risk failure if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  try  something  bold  because  you  might  miss  it.  But  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">also risk failure if you stand still and don't try anything new. G. </p>
<p class="calibre1">K.  Chesterton  wrote,  "I  do  not  believe  in  a  fate  that  falls  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">men  however  they  act;  but  I  do  believe  in  a  fate  that  falls  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">them  unless  they  act."  The  less  you  venture  out,  the  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  risk  of  failure.  Ironically  the  more  you  risk  failure—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually fail—the greater your chances of success. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TRAPS THAT MAKE PEOPLE BACK AWAY FROM RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If risk has such great potential rewards, then why don't people</p>
<p class="calibre1">embrace it as a friend? I believe they don't because they tend</p>
<p class="calibre1">to fall into one or more of the following six traps:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. The Embarrassment Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep  down,  nobody  wants  to  look  bad. And  if  you  take  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk and fall flat on your face, you might embarrass yourself. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">what?  Get  over  it.  The  only  way  to  become  better  is  to  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps forward—even shaky ones that cause you to fall down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little progress is better than no progress at all. Success comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  taking  many  small  steps.  If  you  stumble  in  a  small  step,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">rarely matters. Don't gift wrap the garbage. Let little failures go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <i class="calibre4">The Rationalization Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People  who  are  caught  in  the  rationalization  trap  second-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>guess everything they do, and as they prepare to take action, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they say to themselves, "Maybe it's really not that important." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the truth is, if you wait long enough,  <i class="calibre4">nothing </i> is important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or  as  Ed's  Fifth  Rule  of  Procrastination  states,  "Spend</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficient  time  confirming  the  need,  and  the  need  will</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappear." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">PROCRASTINATION</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sydney J . Harris says, "Regret for the things we did can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempered by time; it is regret for the things we did not do that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  inconsolable."  If  you  take  risks  and  fail,  you'll  have  fewer</p>
<p class="calibre1">regrets than if you do nothing and fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. The Unrealistic Expectation Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For  some  reason,  many  people  think  everything  in  life</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be easy, and when they find out that achievement takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort, they give up. But success takes hard work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider  this  Latin  proverb:  "If  there  is  no  wind,  row." As</p>
<p class="calibre1">you prepare to take a risk, don't expect to get a favorable wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Begin  with  the  mind-set  that  you  have  to  row;  then  if  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive help, it will be a pleasant surprise. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. The Fairness Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>When  psychologist  M.  Scott  Peck  begins  his  book  <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Road Less Traveled </i> with the words "Life is difficult" what he is</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting  at  is  life  isn't  fair.  Many  people  never  learn  that  fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of acknowledging it and moving on, they expend their</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy  trying  to  find  fairness.  They  say  to  themselves,  "I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn't have to be the one to do this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dick Butler expands on this idea:"Life isn't fair. It isn't going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be fair. Stop sniveling and whining and go out and make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen for you." Wishing that a risk wasn't yours to take won't</p>

<p class="calibre1">about it is your choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">The Timing Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Don Marquis, the famous writer and humorist, was known to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  a  champion  procrastinator.  A  friend  who  knew  of  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">tendency in Marquis asked him how he ever got his day's work</p>
<p class="calibre1">done.  "That's  simple,"  said  Marquis.  "I  just  pretend  that  it's</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday's." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  people  tend  to  think  that  there's  a  perfect  time  to  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything—and  this  isn't  it.  So  they  wait.  But  Jim  Stovall</p>
<p class="calibre1">advises,  "Don't  wait  for  all  the  lights  to  be  green  before  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave  the  house."  If  you  wait  for  perfect  timing,  you'll  wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">forever.  And  the  more  you  wait,  the  more  tired  you'll  get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William James wisely declared, "There is nothing so fatiguing</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task." Don't use</p>
<p class="calibre1">timing as an excuse to procrastinate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">6. The Inspiration Trap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone once said, "You don't have to be great to start, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">you have to start to be great." Many people want to wait for</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspiration before they are willing to step out and take a risk. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">find that's especially true of people with an artistic bent. But as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>playwright Oscar Wilde said, when he was asked the difference</p>
<p class="calibre1">between a professional writer and an amateur, the difference is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  an  amateur  writes  when  he  feels  like  it;  a  professional</p>
<p class="calibre1">writes regardless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  it  comes  to  moving  forward,  Bill  Glass  gives  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">advice: "When you get an insight or inspiration, do something</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  it  in  twenty-four  hours—or  the  odds  are  against  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever acting on it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ARE YOU TAKING ENOUGH RISKS? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  you  examine  the  way  you  live,  consider  whether  you  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking enough risks—not senseless ones, but intelligent ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you don't fall into one of the six traps I just reviewed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  still  may  be  playing  it  too  safe.  How  can  you  tell?  By</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking at your mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fletcher L. Byrom says:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Make  sure  you  generate  a  reasonable  number  of  mistakes. <b class="calibre3">I  </b>know  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes  naturally  to  some  people,  but  too  many  executives  are  so  afraid  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">error  that  they  rigidify  their  organization  with  checks  and  counterchecks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">discourage  innovation,  and,  in  the  end,  so  structure  themselves  that  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">will  miss  the  kind  of  offbeat  opportunity  that  can  send  a  company</p>
<p class="calibre1">skyrocketing.  So  take  a  look  at  your  record,  and  if  you  can  come  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end  of  a  year  and  see  that  you  haven't  made  any  mistakes,  then <b class="calibre3">I  </b>say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">brother, you just haven't tried everything you should have tried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  are  succeeding  in  everything  you  do,  then  you're</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably  not  pushing  yourself  hard  enough. And  that  means</p>
<p class="calibre1">you're not taking enough risks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a><b class="calibre3">ANOTHER KIND OF RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TAKING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">You  may  have  trouble  relating  to  the  great  explorers  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventurers  from  history  such  as  Amelia  Earhart.  The  risks</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  people  took  may  seem  too  different  from  your  life</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation.  If  so,  you  need  to  know  about  the  life  of  someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose quiet willingness to risk may seem more like your own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  name  was  Joseph  Lister,  and  he  was  a  second-</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation physician born in England in 1827. Back in the days</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  he  began  practicing  medicine,  surgery  was  a  painful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grisly affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  had  the  misfortune  of  being  injured  and  requiring</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgery in the mid-1800s, here's what you could have expected:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You  would  have  been  taken  to  a  hospital's  surgical  theater,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">building  that  was  separate  from  the  main  hospital  to  prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  regular  patients  from  becoming  upset  by  the  screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Anesthesia  had  not  yet  been  developed.)  You  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been strapped to a table that looked a lot like the one in your</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen,  under  which  sat  a  tub  of  sand,  positioned  to  catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your surgery would have been performed by a physician or</p>
<p class="calibre1">barber  likely  surrounded  by  a  group  of  observers  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistants. All  of  them  would  be  dressed  in  the  regular  street</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes  they  wore  throughout  the  course  of  the  day  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">traveling  around  town  and  treating  patients.  The  instruments</p>
<p class="calibre1">the doctor used would have been pulled from a nearby drawer</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  they  had  been  placed  (unwashed)  after  the  previous</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>surgery.  And  if  your  surgeon  needed  his  hands  free  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">working on you, he might have held the surgical knife between</p>
<p class="calibre1">his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your  chances  of  surviving  surgery  would  be  a  little  better</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  50  percent.  If  you  had  the  misfortune  of  having  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">operation  in  a  military  hospital,  your  chances  of  surviving</p>
<p class="calibre1">would go down to about 10 percent. Of surgery during that era, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  contemporary  doctor  wrote,"A  man  laid  on  the  operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">table  in  one  of  our  surgical  hospitals  is  exposed  to  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances  of  death  than  the  English  soldier  on  the  field  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Waterloo." <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DETERMINED TO MAKE A</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DIFFERENCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  other  surgeons  of  his  time,  Lister  was  distressed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the death rate of his patients, but he was ignorant of the cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he was determined to discover a way to save more of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his patients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister's  first  major  breakthrough  came  after  he  was  given</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  writings  by  his  friend  Thomas  Anderson,  a  chemistry</p>
<p class="calibre1">professor. The papers were written by scientist Louis Pasteur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  them  the  French  scientist  stated  his  opinion  that  gangrene</p>
<p class="calibre1">was caused not by air, but by bacteria and germs present in air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister thought those ideas were remarkable. And he theorized</p>
<p class="calibre1">that if the dangerous microbes could be eliminated, his patients</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  a  better  chance  of  avoiding  gangrene,  blood</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>poisoning, and the other infections that often killed them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">INNOVATION MAKES HIM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AN OUTCAST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  of  what  we  know  today  about  germs  and  infection, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister's ideas may seem to be common sense. But his belief was</p>
<p class="calibre1">radical  in  those  days—even  among  members  of  the  medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">community. And when Lister, who was working at a hospital in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edinburgh,  presented  his  beliefs  to  the  senior  surgeons,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was taunted, ridiculed, and rejected. Each day as he made his</p>
<p class="calibre1">rounds,  his  colleagues  insulted  and  criticized  him  mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was an outcast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  rejection  of  his  peers  and  an  inherently  gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature, Lister refused to back down. He continued his work on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the problem, but did his research at home. For a long time he</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  his  wife  worked  in  a  laboratory  they  had  created  in  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen.  The  key,  he  believed,  was  to  find  a  substance  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be capable of killing the microbes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister  finally  settled  on  carbolic  acid,  a  substance  used  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean the sewage system in the city of Carlisle. His preliminary</p>
<p class="calibre1">research done, he was ready to test his theory. But that would</p>
<p class="calibre1">require another risk, one greater than rejection by his peers—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  would  have  to  experiment  with  carbolic  acid  on  a  living</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient, not knowing whether it would kill him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a><b class="calibre3">A GREATER RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister  determined  to  wait  until  he  found  the  right  person.  It</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  require  someone  who  faced  almost  certain  death.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">found his patient on August 12, 1865. An eleven-year-old boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">who had been run over by a cart was brought into the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His leg had been so badly damaged that the broken bones had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come  through  the  skin.  And  his  injury  was  more  than  eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours  old.  He  was  the  kind  of  patient  who  usually  didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister  used  carbolic  acid  to  clean  the  wound,  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">instruments,  and  anything  that  came  into  contact  with  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient.  He  also  dressed  the  wound  with  bandages  soaked  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the substance. Then he waited. One day, two days, three days, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  four  days  passed.  To  his  joy,  after  four  days  there  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">no signs of fever or blood poisoning. After six weeks, the boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">was able to walk again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amid  heavy  criticism,  Lister  used  carbolic  acid  in  all  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">procedures.  During  1865  and  1866,  he  treated  eleven  patients</p>
<p class="calibre1">with compound fractures, and none of his patients contracted</p>
<p class="calibre1">infections.  As  he  continued  his  new  procedures,  he  did</p>
<p class="calibre1">research to improve his methods, finding additional antiseptic</p>
<p class="calibre1">substances that worked even better. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE RESULT OF RISK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1867,  Lister  published  his  findings,  and  still  the  medical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>profession  ridiculed  him.  For  more  than  a  decade,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicated  his  findings  and  encouraged  other  doctors  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopt his practices. Finally in 1881, sixteen years after his first</p>
<p class="calibre1">success  with  a  patient,  his  peers  at  the  International  Medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress held in London recognized his advances. They called</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  work  perhaps  the  greatest  advance  that  surgery  had  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">made. <a href="index_split_003.html#p272">8 </a>In 1883, he was knighted. In 1897, he was made a baron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, if you've had any kind of surgery, as I have, you owe</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Joseph  Lister  a  debt  of  gratitude.  His  risk  secured  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lister's  risks  may  not  look  as  flashy  as  those  taken  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone like Amelia Earhart, but that doesn't matter. What he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did  brought  great  personal  achievement  to  him  and  lasting</p>
<p class="calibre1">benefits to others. He wasn't content with success as a doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He attempted something more difficult—and riskier. And that's</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  matters.  You  risk  because  you  have  something  of  value</p>
<p class="calibre1">you want to achieve. That's just another part of failing forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Your Eleventh Step to Failing Forward:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">If at First You Do Succeed, Try Something</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Harder</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  willingness  to  take  greater  risks  is  a  major  key  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving success, and you may be surprised that it can solve</p>
<p class="calibre1">two very different kinds of problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, if you've been hitting all the goals you set for yourself, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>then  you  need  to  increase  your  willingness  to  take  chances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The road to the next level is always uphill, so you can't coast</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversely,  if  you  find  yourself  in  a  place  where  it  seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">that you don't achieve many of your goals, you may be playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  too  safe.  Once  again,  the  answer  is  a  willingness  to  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  risks.  (It's  ironic  that  opposite  ends  of  the  spectrum</p>
<p class="calibre1">come together in the area of risk.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Think  about  the  next  big  goal  ahead  of  you.  Write  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">your plan for reaching it. Then go over that plan to see whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  have  included  enough  risks.  If  not,  find  parts  of  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">process where you can push the envelope, take more chances, </p>

<p class="calibre1">drastic disability? The answer can be found on Mount Everest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  see,  Beck  Weathers  was  one  of  the  people  on  that  peak</p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  now-famous  incident  in  1996  when  a  blizzard  cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve people their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NO ORDINARY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOUNTAIN TOP</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">EXPERIENCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers was forty-nine years old when he ascended Everest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  point,  he  had  been  a  mountain  climber  for  ten  years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it consumed him. He acknowledges, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  regret  the  time  taken  away  from  my  family,  from  my  wife  and  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">children. There's a large dose of selfishness involved in such an activity . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. I realize I was defining myself by climbing and not dealing with the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my life. It's an excessive goal, and it never ends. You get about one day</p>
<p class="calibre1">of happiness, and then you're planning your next trip. <a href="index_split_003.html#p273">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers  always  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  preparation  for  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">next  trip.  Before  Everest,  he  had  scaled  six  of  the  seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">summits,  the  highest  mountains  on  the  continents.  And  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">each climb he underwent a grueling training regimen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  Everest  climb,  Weathers  signed  on  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expedition led by New Zealander Rob Hall. Before the team got</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the high camp (at twenty-six thousand feet), Weathers was</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing  fine,  despite  the  difficult  conditions—bitter  cold  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>one-third  of  the  oxygen  present  at  sea  level.  But  as  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascended  the  peak  on  May  10,  Weathers  realized  he  was  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble.  Some  years  before,  he  had  undergone  radial</p>
<p class="calibre1">keratotomy  surgery  to  correct  his  vision. As  he  went  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountain, the altitude caused the lenses in his eyes to flatten</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, and that made him blind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LEFT FOR DEAD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time, the wisest decision seemed to be for Weathers to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait  where  he  was,  then  rejoin  the  crew  as  they  came  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  from  the  summit.  But  Weathers's  disappointment  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  overshadowed  by  nightmarish  weather  conditions.  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">freak  blizzard  rapidly  enveloped  the  mountain,  dropping  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">temperature  to  about  fifty  degrees  below  zero  and  increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">winds  to  seventy  miles  per  hour.  The  storm  made  everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">scramble  for  survival.  As  that  happened,  Weathers  was  left</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  on  the  mountain.  Hours  passed,  and  he  lapsed  into  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypothermic coma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellow climbers searched for Weathers for hours. And early</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  morning  on  May  11,  they  found  him;  he  was  covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">with ice and barely breathing. They knew he would die, so they</p>
<p class="calibre1">left him where he was, returned to camp, and radioed to his wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he was dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  person  has  ever  come  out  of  a  hypothermic  coma  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived—except  Beck  Weathers.  Somehow,  he  revived,  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,  found  his  way,  and  staggered  back  into  camp.  His  jacket</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  open,  his  face  was  black  beyond  recognition  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">frostbite,  and  his  exposed  right  arm  was  marble-white  and</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">RESURRECTION! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  after  his  miraculous  return  to  camp,  nobody  thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers  would  survive.  But  he  kept  pulling  through.  Back</p>
<p class="calibre1">home  in  Dallas,  he  received  medical  attention.  He  underwent</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten  surgeries;  they  amputated  the  fingers  on  his  left  hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">amputated  his  right  arm  near  the  elbow,  and  reconstructed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new nose using tissue from other parts of his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  it  all,  Weathers  went  through  a  radical  learning</p>
<p class="calibre1">process.  He  believes  he  traded  his  hands  for  something  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable—lessons  about  himself,  his  values,  and  life.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">admits, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm  probably  a  much  happier  person  now  having  gone  through  what  I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone through. I have a different set of priorities. You never know who you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are and what you are until you've really been tested. You gain a whole lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  from  having  failure  kicked  up  from  around  your  ears  than  success</p>
<p class="calibre1">could ever teach you. <a href="index_split_003.html#p273">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Beck Weathers's attitude reflects more than just gratitude for</p>
<p class="calibre1">surviving a tragedy that should have killed him. He displays a</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachability  that  has  allowed  him  to  change  his  life  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better.  He  has  failed  forward  by  making  hardship  his  best</p>

<p class="calibre1">Fortunately  you  don't  have  to  be  left  for  dead  on  top  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">word  his  way  for  the  next  thirty  years. As  Louis Armstrong</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Your attitude toward failure determines your altitude after failure. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Teachability is an attitude, a mind-set that says, "No matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">how  much  I  know  (or  think  I  know),  I  can  learn  from  this</p>

<p class="calibre1">into advantage. It can make you a winner even during the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult circumstances. Sydney Harris sums up the elements of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a teachable mind-set: "A winner knows how much he still has</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  learn,  even  when  he  is  considered  an  expert  by  others. A</p>

<p class="calibre1">foolish  one:  "The  most  important  thing  in  life  is  not  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalize  on  our  gains.  Any  fool  can  do  that.  The  really</p>

<p class="calibre1">Anyone can make failure a friend by maintaining a teachable</p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude and using a strategy for learning from failure. To turn</p>

<p class="calibre1">You cannot find out what you can do unless you do all you</p>

<p class="calibre1">You need to determine if what happened was really a failure. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  novelist  and  a  friend  had  a  heated  argument,  and  one</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. What Successes Are Contained in the Failure? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An old saying states,"The gem cannot be polished without</p>

<p class="calibre1">of  failure  you  experience,  there  is  always  a  potential  jewel  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">I enjoy reading the comic strip  <i class="calibre4">Peanuts </i> by Charles Schulz. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  my  favorites,  Charlie  Brown  is  at  the  beach  building  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful sand castle. As he stands back to admire his work, it</p>

<p class="calibre1">says,  "There  must  be  a  lesson  here,  but  I  don't  know  what  it</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">BYRON</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That's the way many people approach adversity. They are so</p>
<p class="calibre1">consumed by the events that they become bewildered and miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  whole  learning  experience.  But  there  is  always  a  way  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn  from  failures  and  mistakes.  Poet  Lord  Byron  was  right</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he stated, "Adversity is the first path to truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Restaurateur Wolfgang Puck says, "I learned more from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one. restaurant that didn't work than from all the ones that were</p>
<p class="calibre1">successes." And success is something he knows a lot about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  owns  five  critically  acclaimed  restaurants  in  California—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spago,  Chinois  on  Main,  Postrio,  the  Eureka  Brewery,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Granita—and  he  has  also  opened  restaurants  in  Chicago,  Las</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vegas, and Tokyo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  difficult  to  give  general  guidelines  about  how  to  learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  mistakes  because  every  situation  is  different.  But  if  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintain a teachable attitude as you approach the process and</p>
<p class="calibre1">try  to  learn  <i class="calibre4">anything </i> you  can  about  what  you  could  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">differently, you will improve yourself. When a person has the</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">5. Am I Grateful for the Experience? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One way to maintain a teachable mind-set is to cultivate an</p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude of gratitude. And that's possible even in the face of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  American  sprinter  Eddie  Hart  missed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">preliminary  heat  for  the  one-hundred-meter  sprint  in  the  1972</p>
<p class="calibre1">Olympics in Munich. As a result, he lost his chance to win an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual  gold  medal.  But  his  perspective  on  the  experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">was good. He said, "Everything you pursue you won't always</p>
<p class="calibre1">attain. That's probably the most important lesson I learned from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>missing that race. There are times in life when you may not get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the raise you want, the job you want. You have to learn to live</p>
<p class="calibre1">with your defeats. And athletics are valuable, because they're</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  about  winning  and  losing.  Before  you  can  actually  be  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good winner, you have to know how to lose." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hart was grateful for the medal he received as a member of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  relay  team—and  for  the  lesson  it  taught  him  about  living</p>
<p class="calibre1">with defeats. As you come away from a failure, try to cultivate</p>

<p class="calibre1">learned from the mistakes of others. I recommend that you learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the mistakes of others as much as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning from your failures is always easier with the help of</p>

<p class="calibre1">Seeking advice from the right person is important. I heard a</p>

<p class="calibre1">Before  long,  the  man  was  in  trouble  with  the  press,  so  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided to open the first envelope. The note said,"Blame your</p>

<p class="calibre1">For a while things went smoothly. But a few months later, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was in trouble again, so he opened the second envelope. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">note said, "Reorganize." So that's what he did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That bought him more time. But because he had never really</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved any of the issues that were causing him problems, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">ended  up  in  trouble  again,  and  this  time  it  was  even  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">than before. In desperation, he opened the last envelope. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the  <i class="calibre4">Los  Angeles  Times </i> that  almost  made  me  change  my  mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">about luck. Here's what it said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">NEW  YORK—Jolted,  jilted,  hammered  in  a  car  crash  and  robbed, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nearly electrocuted in a construction site accident in 1984 that put him in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  coma  for  weeks,  Hanratty  lost  the  lawyers  righting  for  his  disability</p>
<p class="calibre1">claim—one was disbarred, two died—and his wife ran off with her lawyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hanratty, who has spent years  fighting  heart  and  liver  disease,  had  his  car</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrecked in a crash last year. When police left the scene of the accident, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was held up and robbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  say  to  myself,'How  much  more  am  I  going  to  be  tested  in  life  to  see</p>

<p class="calibre1">I think the experiences of Lawrence Hanratty are not typical</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  most  people  who  continually  fail  or  experience  continual</p>

<p class="calibre1">was  a  warrior  who  was  totally  indestructible—except  in  one</p>

<p class="calibre1">By  far  the  greatest  single  obstacle  to  success  that  I  see  in</p>

<p class="calibre1">executives fail. At the top of the list was a person's inability to</p>
<p class="calibre1">effectively relate to others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was talking to some people a couple of days ago, and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  complaining  about  not  winning  a  business  contract  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had bid on. "It wasn't fair," one person told me. "All the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people involved knew each other, and we didn't have a chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  all  politics."  But  what  he  went  on  to  describe  wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics. It was relationships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Authors Carole Hyatt and Linda Gottlieb indicate that people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  fail  on  the  job  commonly  cite  "office  politics"  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason  for  their  failures,  but  the  reality  is  that  what  they  call</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics  is  often  nothing  more  than  regular  interaction  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">other people. Hyatt and Gottlieb assert, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  careers  involve  other  people.  You  can  have  great  academic</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence  and  still  lack  social  intelligence—the  ability  to  be  a  good</p>

<p class="calibre1">with her husband to the California desert during World War II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  she  had  grown  up  in  the  East,  the  desert  seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>remote and desolate to her. Where they lived didn't make it any</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier.  The  only  housing  they  could  find  was  a  shack  near  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">village of Native Americans, none of whom spoke English. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent a lot of time there alone, waiting out the sweltering heat</p>
<p class="calibre1">each day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  her  husband  was  gone  for  a  long  period,  she  wrote</p>

<p class="calibre1">Two men looked from prison bars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">One saw mud, the other stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  words  helped  the  young  woman  to  see  things  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly.  Maybe  she  couldn't  improve  her  circumstances,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she  could  improve  herself.  She  made  friends  with  her  Native</p>

<p class="calibre1">discover its natural beauty. All of a sudden, she was living in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  world—and  the  only  thing  that  had  changed  was  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If your circumstances constantly get you down, then maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">it's  time  for  a  change—not  in  your  situation,  but  in  your</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Lack  of Focus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>Bad  things  happen  when  a  person  doesn't  focus.  Let  me</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrate with a story. One day a businessman visited a small-</p>
<p class="calibre1">town florist shop to order flowers for a friend who was opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  new  business.  The  floral  shop  owner  was  unusually  busy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  was  scrambling  to  fill  orders  while  she  took  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman's information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later that day, the man arrived at his friend's grand opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saw a big floral wreath with his name on it that said,"With</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deepest Sympathy During This Time of Sorrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The businessman was irate. He called the florist to complain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  asked,  "What  in  the  world  happened?  Do  you  have  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea how stupid you made me look?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm so sorry," the shop owner said, "I was a little scrambled</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you came by. But your situation wasn't nearly as bad as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was at the funeral home. That card said,'Best Wishes in Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">New Location.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anybody  can  make  an  honest  mistake  when  things  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">hectic.  But  people  lacking  focus  have  trouble  not  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they're too busy, but because their priorities are out of whack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And that wastes their time and resources. If you go from task</p>
<p class="calibre1">to task to task without making any progress, or you can't seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to reach a goal no matter how much effort you give it, examine</p>
<p class="calibre1">your focus. No one can move forward without it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">A Weak  Commitment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For  a  long  time,  it  seemed  that  apathy  was  chic.  But  effort</p>
<p class="calibre1">and commitment seem to be coming back into style. And that's</p>
<p class="calibre1">good  because  without  commitment,  you  cannot  accomplish</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything  of  value.  Johann  Wolfgang  von  Goethe  addressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the importance of commitment: "Until one is committed, there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitance,  the  chance  to  draw  back,  and  always  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>effectiveness . . . The moment one definitely commits oneself... </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  whole  stream  of  events  issue  from  the  decision,  raising  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones  favor  all  manner  of  unforeseen  incidents  and  material</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance which no man could have dreamed would come his</p>
<p class="calibre1">way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  last  time  you  failed,  did  you  stop  trying  because  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed, or did you fail because you stopped trying? What was</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  level  of  commitment?  Did  you  give  the  task  everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  had?  Did  you  go  the  extra  mile?  Did  you  put  enough  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself  on  the  line  to  guarantee  that  you  would  give  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">very best? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you're committed, a failure doesn't mean that you'll never</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed. It just means you will take longer. Commitment makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">you capable of failing forward until you reach your goals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Dealing with a Dead Horse." I thought the list was hilarious:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Buy a stronger whip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Change riders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Appoint a committee to study the horse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Appoint a team to revive the horse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Send out a memo declaring the horse isn't really dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>6. Hire an expensive consultant to find "the real problem." </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  Harness  several  dead  horses  together  for  increased  speed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and efficiency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8. Rewrite the standard definition of  <i class="calibre4">live horse. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">9.  Declare  the  horse  to  be  better,  faster,  and  cheaper  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">10. Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position. </p>
