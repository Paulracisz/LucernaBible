  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">I bet you've seen just about every one of these "solutions" </p>
<p class="calibre1">enacted  in  your  place  of  work.  But  there's  really  only  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">effective  way  to  deal  with  that  problem:  When  your  horse  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead, for goodness' sake, dismount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  <i class="calibre4">Calvin  and  Hobbes </i> comic strip portrayed the way that</p>
<p class="calibre1">too  many  of  us  perceive  change.  Calvin  and  his  stuffed-tiger</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend  were  speeding  down  a  hill  in  the  boy's  wagon.  Calvin</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelled back to Hobbes, "I thrive on change." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprised,  Hobbes  remarked,  "You?  You  threw  a  fit  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning  because  your  mom  put  less  jelly  on  your  toast  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calvin  faced  Hobbes  and  explained,  "I  thrive  on  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">other people change." </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  don't  have  to  love  change  to  be  successful,  but  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to be willing to accept it. Change is a catalyst for personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth. It gets you out of a rut, it gives you a fresh start, and it</p>
<p class="calibre1">affords you an opportunity to reevaluate your direction. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">resist change, you're really resisting  success.  Learn  flexibility, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or learn to like living with your failures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The common denominator of success lies in forming the habit of doing things</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">that failures don't like to do. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">—ALBERT GRAY</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  <i class="calibre4">A Shortcut Mind-Set</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A common obstacle to success is the desire to cut corners</p>
<p class="calibre1">and take the short road to success. But shortcuts never pay off</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the long run. As Napoleon said, victory belongs to the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">persevering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  people  tend  to  underestimate  the  time  it  takes  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve something of value, but to be successful, you have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  willing  to  pay  your  dues.  James  Watt  spent  twenty  years</p>
<p class="calibre1">laboring  to  perfect  his  steam  engine.  William  Harvey  labored</p>
<p class="calibre1">night and day for eight years to prove how blood circulated in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the human body. And it took another twenty-five years for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical profession to acknowledge he was right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cutting corners is really a sign of impatience and poor self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">discipline.  But  if  you  are  willing  to  follow  through,  you  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve a breakthrough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why Albert Gray says, "The common denominator of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success  lies  in  forming  the  habit  of  doing  things  that  failures</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't like to do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  continually  give  in  to  your  moods  or  impulses,  then</p>
<p class="calibre1">you need to change your approach to doing things. The best</p>
<p class="calibre1">method  is  to  set  standards  for  yourself  that  <i class="calibre4">require</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">accountability.  Suffering  a  consequence  for  not  following</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  helps  you  stay  on  track.  Once  you  have  your  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards  in  place,  work  according  to  them,  not  your  moods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That will get you going in the right direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>Self-discipline  is  a  quality  that  is  won  through  practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist Joseph Mancusi noted, "Truly successful people</p>
<p class="calibre1">have learned to do what does not come naturally. Real success</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies in experiencing fear or aversion and acting in spite of it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">8. Relying on Talent Alone</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Talent  is  overrated.  Not  because  it  doesn't  have  value,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">because talent alone isn't enough to take a person through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiple failures that life brings. Adding a strong work ethic to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent is like pouring gasoline on a fire. It's explosive! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  great  artists  understand  this,  though  some  nonartists</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakenly  believe  that  talent  alone  carries  them  through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David Bayles and Ted Orland explain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  at  best,  talent  remains  a  constant,  and  those  who  rely  upon  that  gift</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone,  without  developing  further,  peak  quickly  and  soon  fade  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscurity. Examples of genius only accentuate that truth. Newspapers love</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  print  stories  about  five-year-old  musical  prodigies  giving  solo  recitals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  you  rarely  read  about  one  going  on  to  become  a  Mozart.  The  point</p>
<p class="calibre1">here is that whatever his initial gift, Mozart was also an artist who learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  work  on  his  work,  and  thereby  improved.  In  that  respect  he  shares</p>
<p class="calibre1">common ground with the rest of us. <a href="#p274">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  greater  your  talent,  the  more  likely  you  are  to  lean</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavily on it and skip the hard day-to-day work of improving it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  possess  this  negative  tendency,  put  yourself  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth plan so that you can make the most of your God-given</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">9. A Response to Poor Information</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Successful  executives  have  in  common  the  ability  to  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">weighty  decisions  based  on  limited  amounts  of  information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  they  also  have  in  common  the  ability  to  gather  reliable</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  to  use  as  they  evaluate  issues.  General  Douglas</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>MacArthur  knew  this.  He  asserted,  "Expect  only  5  percent  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  intelligence  report  to  be  accurate.  The  trick  of  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">commander is to isolate the 5 percent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the pace of life and business increases, the difficulty of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being able to collect and evaluate information will increase. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,  Bill  Gates's  best-selling  book  <i class="calibre4">Business  @  the  Speed  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Thought </i> was written specifically to address this issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An example of what can go wrong when decisions are made</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the basis of poor information is evident in the purchase of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. Volkswagen and B MW battled each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  to  purchase  Rolls-Royce  from  Vickers  PLC.  And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Volkswagen won the battle, paying $780 million for the luxury</p>
<p class="calibre1">auto-making company. But after the purchase was finalized, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">buyers  made  a  shocking  discovery.  Volkswagen  owned  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">company, but not the rights to the name Rolls-Royce, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">synonymous with luxury cars around the world. The license for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  name,  it  turned  out,  belonged  to  another  company:  Rolls-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Royce  PLC,  an  aerospace  company.  Even  worse,  Rolls-Royce</p>
<p class="calibre1">PLC had ties to BMW. Guess who received permission to use</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  name?  BMW—not  Volkswagen.  And  it  all  happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of poor information gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">10. No Goals</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The last major cause of failure is an absence of goals. Don</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marquis  perceives  that  "ours  is  a  world  where  people  don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">know what they want and are willing to go through hell to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe L. Griffith believes, "A goal is nothing more than a dream</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a time limit." Many people don't have goals because they</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven't  allowed  themselves  to  dream. As  a  result,  they  don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">possess  a  desire.  If  that  describes  you,  then  you  must  look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>deep within yourself and try to determine why you re on this</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet. Once you've discovered that, you'll know what to shoot</p>
<p class="calibre1">for.(I'll talk more about this in the next chapter.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Ours is a world where people don't know what they want and are willing to go</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">through hell to get it. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—DON MARQUIS</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  can  discover  the  weakness  that  weakens  you,  then</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can start doing something about it. And that can change</p>
<p class="calibre1">your life. I've seen that happen again and again in people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire success. Let me tell you about one of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PUTTING PURPOSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEFORE PEOPLE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  people  I  rely  on  most  at  The  INJOY  Group  is  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">good  friend  Dan  Reiland.  He  and  I  have  worked  together  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeen  years.  For  more  than  a  decade  Dan  was  my  right</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  at  Skyline  Church,  serving  as  my  executive  pastor.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn't  have  succeeded  without  him.  When  I  resigned  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  pastorate  to  lead  The  INJOY  Group  full-time,  I  took  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  me.  Today,  he  serves  as  INJOY's  vice  president  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership development and church growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  say  that  Dan  is  naturally  purpose  driven  would  be  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">understatement.  He  is  highly  organized,  and  he  goes  after  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">goal with a vengeance. When I first met him, if he had dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>his briefcase and it had broken open, the contents would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen  out  in  alphabetical  order.  But  as  is  the  case  with  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">people,  Dan's  strength  was  also  his  weakness.  Let's  just  say</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  because  he  was  purpose  driven,  he  was  not  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">relational guy in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GOING RIGHT PAST HIS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WORK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Initially  Dan  held  the  position  of  intern.  I  remember  one  day</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon after he started the job, I was standing in the office lobby</p>
<p class="calibre1">having a conversation with a group of people, and Dan came in</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  parking  lot  with  his  carefully  arranged  briefcase.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked right through the group of us and didn't say a word. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">strode down the hall directly to his office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I excused myself from the group, and I followed him. Dan set</p>
<p class="calibre1">his briefcase down on his desk, and when he turned around, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was surprised to see that I was standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dan," I said, "what are you doing? You walked right by us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you didn't say anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I have a lot of work to do," Dan answered, pulling out</p>
<p class="calibre1">a stack of papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dan," I said looking him in the eye, "you just passed your</p>
<p class="calibre1">work." I wanted him to understand that people come first to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">leader. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a><b class="calibre3">MAKING CHANGES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the next year, Dan and I worked together, and I mentored</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in the area of people skills. Dan worked especially hard; he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was dedicated to improving himself. And you know, every year</p>
<p class="calibre1">he got better. Today, if you were to meet Dan, you would think</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  his  ability  to  work  with  people  is  a  natural  strength</p>
<p class="calibre1">because he is so good at it. He is now one of the finest pastoral</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaders in the country. And if I have a tricky assignment that</p>
<p class="calibre1">requires someone with exceptional people skills to carry it out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">do you know who is on my short list of choices? Dan. And that</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  become  possible  because  of  his  willingness  to  grow  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">change. He has taken a weakness and turned it into a strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  are  dedicated  to  overcoming  failure  and  achieving</p>
<p class="calibre1">lasting  success,  then  you  need  to  be  willing  to  do  the  same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Work on the weakness that weakens you, and there's no telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">how far you will go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Your Thirteenth Step to Failing Forward:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Work on the Weakness That Weakens You</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody  has  weaknesses.  Review  the  top  ten  reasons</p>
<p class="calibre1">people fail, and determine whether you need to work on one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these areas. (Or you may have a different issue that isn't listed</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>Start  improving  yourself  by  talking  to  a  trusted  friend. Ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">him  to  help  you  evaluate  yourself  in  your  area  of  weakness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then put yourself on a growth plan to turn that weakness into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  strength.  The  plan  may  include  reading  books,  attending</p>
<p class="calibre1">classes or seminars, or finding a mentor. Determine to put your</p>
<p class="calibre1">plan into action, and stick with it for  <i class="calibre4">a year. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  end  of  that  time,  go  back  to  the  friend  who  helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  evaluate  yourself,  and  ask  the  person  to  evaluate  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">progress. If you still need improvement, begin a second phase</p>
<p class="calibre1">of growth, following it as long as you must to keep growing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Steps to Failing Forward:</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Realize there is one major difference between average people</p>
<p class="calibre1">and achieving people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Learn a new definition of  <i class="calibre4">failure. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Remove the "you" from failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Take action and reduce your fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Change your response to failure by accepting responsibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Don't let the failure from outside get inside you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7. Say good-bye to yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8. Change yourself, and your world changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9. Get over yourself and start giving yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>10. Find the benefit in every bad experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">11. If at first you do succeed, try something harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">12. Learn from a bad experience and make it a good experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">13. Work on the weakness that weakens you. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">There is no failure except no longer trying There is no defeat except from within, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">no really insurmountable barrier save our own inherent weakness of purpose. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">M</b>ost  unsuccessful  people  believe  that  a  huge  gaping  chasm</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands  between  them  and  success.  They  suspect  deep  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  will  never  be  able  to  cross  that  void  and  get  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other side in achieving their dreams. But I want to let you in on</p>
<p class="calibre1">a little secret. There's not much difference between failure and</p>
<p class="calibre1">success, and the little difference makes a big difference. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">creates that difference? Let me share a story with you, and you</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be able to guess what the difference maker is. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE START OF AN UPHILL BATTLE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  think  everybody  in  the  United  States  has  heard  of  Macy's</p>
<p class="calibre1">department  store,  thanks  to  its  famous  Thanksgiving  Day</p>
<p class="calibre1">parade and the movie  <i class="calibre4">Miracle on 34th Street. </i> But fewer people</p>
<p class="calibre1">know about the man who founded the store in 1858. His name</p>
<p class="calibre1">was R.H.Macy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The son of a sea captain, Macy was born in Nantucket at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  when  whaling  was  king.  His  first  job  was  on  a  whaling</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship at age fifteen. He spent four years on that ship and saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world, traveling as far as New Zealand. When he returned</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>to  the  United  States  with  his  share  of  the  ship's  earnings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  amounted  to  $500,  he  was  finished  with  the  sea.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  several  odd  jobs  and  then  took  a  position  as  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">apprentice  in  a  printing  shop.  But  he  lasted  only  six  months</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. He had greater ambition than the printing trade offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A VENTURE INTO RETAIL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when he decided to try his hand at retail trade. With the</p>
<p class="calibre1">money  he  had  saved  from  his  time  at  sea,  he  opened  a  small</p>
<p class="calibre1">thread  and  needle  store  in  Boston.  His  hopes  were  high,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his work ethic was strong, but the business failed within a year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next year, Macy tried again. His second store traded in</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry  goods,  mainly  European-made  items  bought  at  auction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again he worked hard, and again he failed. The following year, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  decided  to  team  with  his  brother-in-law,  Samuel  S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Houghton,  who  eventually  founded  Houghton  and  Dutton  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boston. He worked with him and learned a lot, but after a year, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he decided that he needed a change. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Go WEST, YOUNG MAN? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">R. H. Macy and his brother Charles had heard about the gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">strike in California, and they decided to head west and try their</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands  at  mining.  Though  they  failed  to  strike  it  rich,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  recognized  that  there  were  opportunities  to  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">money  selling  goods  to  the  miners.  Along  with  two  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">partners,  they  opened  Macy  and  Company  in  Marysville,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>town north of Sacramento. And they did fairly well—until the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold  ran  out  and  the  miners  left  the  area.  So  they  sold  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">business to a competitor and moved back east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy's  next  venture  was  a  dry  goods  store  in  Haverhill, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Massachusetts,  a  town  north  of  Boston.  He  had  learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">something from each business he had run, and he was starting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to formulate a unique philosophy of trade. At his newest store, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy  introduced  innovations  that  would  later  become  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">trademark:  selling  at  a  fixed  price  while  other  stores  haggled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">buying  and  selling  for  cash  only,  and  advertising  heavily.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">even wrote his own copy and designed the layout for each ad, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing on his time in the printing business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately he couldn't make it in that business either, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">he closed its doors. He wasn't defeated, though. The following</p>
<p class="calibre1">year,  he  opened  another  store,  and  he  sold  goods  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowest  prices  in  town.  Yet  despite  his  innovations,  his  clever</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertising,  and  his  hard  work,  that  business  didn't  make  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  three  years  of  struggle  in  a  relatively  small  town,  Macy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sold out and declared bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAKING A CHANGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At that point Macy decided to get out of retail. For a while he</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked as a stockbroker, then as a real estate broker. He moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Wisconsin  to  pursue  an  opportunity,  but  a  financial  panic</p>
<p class="calibre1">that year dashed his hopes of making it really big. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the difficult times, he achieved modest success, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  was  able  to  make  some  money.  With  Macy's  big</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  in  Wisconsin  having  fallen  through,  a  friend</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>convinced him to give the retail trade another try. Once again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he returned to the West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  tried  five  professions—whaler,  retailer,  gold  miner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stockbroker,  and  real  estate  broker.  And  this  would  be  his</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">seventh </i> attempt in retail. He must have been weary, yet he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">only thirty-five years old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  decided  to  try  his  luck  in  Manhattan. And  that  was  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make  a  tremendous  difference.  Even  then  New  York  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">largest  city  in  the  United  States,  and  with  a  population  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">950,000  was  one  hundred  times  larger  than  the  Haverhill  area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  New  York  was  still  growing.  In  1858,  R  .  H  .  M  a  c  y</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened a fancy dry goods store. After only twelve months, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was grossing $80,000 a year. By the 1870s, the store averaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than $1 million in sales per year. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE FATHER OF RETAIL AS WE KNOW IT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Macy's  business  grew,  he  revolutionized  retail  trade.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">can be credited with numerous innovations:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Inventing the concept of the modern department store</p>
<p class="calibre1">•  Making  set  prices  the  norm  in  the  industry  instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">haggling</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Buying and selling in high volume in order to provide lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices for customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Introducing modern retail advertising</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Appointing the first female executive in retail history</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>In  1877,  Macy  died  while  on  a  buying  trip  in  Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  his  business  lived  on—and  it  continued  to  bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">innovation  to  retail  trade.  Today,  the  company  serves</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers with 191 Macy's stores. Those stores exist because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of one man who refused to give up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE POWER OF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PERSISTENCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  you  have  no  doubt  guessed,  the  quality  that  took  Macy</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  failure  after  failure  after  failure  was  his  persistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the little difference that makes a big difference when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes  to  failing  forward.  It  separates  those  who  achieve</p>
<p class="calibre1">success from those who only dream about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">More than anything else, what keeps a person going in the midst of adversity is</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">having a sense of purpose. It is the fuel that powers persistence. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing worth achieving comes easily. The only way to fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward  and  achieve  your  dreams  is  to  cultivate  tenacity  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">persistence.  These  qualities  can  be  learned,  partly  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">developing  the  habit  of  following  through  on  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">commitments  when  you  don't  feel  like  it.  But  to  begin</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultivating  these  qualities,  you  need  a  strategy.  And  that's</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  I  want  to  give  you  now—a  four-point  plan  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching  achievement  that  will  encourage  stamina  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">resilience in the face of failures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a> <i class="calibre4">1. Purpose: Find One</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">More than anything else, having a sense of purpose keeps a</p>
<p class="calibre1">person  going  in  the  midst  of  adversity.  It  is  the  fuel  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers persistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  consultant  Paul  Stoltz  did  an  extensive  study  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  it  takes  for  individuals  to  persist  through  setbacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Stoltz,  the  most  important  ingredient  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">persistence is this:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Always bear in mind that your resolution to succeed is more important than</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Identifying  your  mountain,  your  purpose  in  life,  so  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">work you do is meaningful. I run into people every day who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">basically climbing the wrong mountain. People who have spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">20  years  or  more  of  their  lives  doing  something  that  has  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep  purpose  for  them.  Suddenly  they  look  back  and  go, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What have I been doing?" <a href="#p275">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  are  a  purpose-driven  person  naturally,  then  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably  already  possess  an  innate  sense  of  direction  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">helps you overcome adversity. But if you're not, then you may</p>
<p class="calibre1">need some help. Use the following steps to help you  <i class="calibre4">develop a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">desire. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">• Get next to people who possess great desire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Develop discontent with the status quo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Search for a goal that excites you. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>• Put your most vital possessions into that goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Visualize yourself enjoying the rewards of that goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you follow this strategy, you may not immediately find your</p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimate  purpose,  but  you  will  at  least  start  moving  in  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction.  And  that's  important.  As  Abraham  Lincoln</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,"Always  bear  in  mind  that  your  resolution  to  succeed  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  important  than  any  other  thing."  That  resolution  comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a sense of purpose. </p>

<p class="calibre1">have the habit of making excuses." Having desire alone will not</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  you  through  your  failures.  You  have  to  forget  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">making excuses and keep moving forward, as R .  H  .  M  a  c  y</p>
<p class="calibre1">did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recently  I  read  a  story  about  Dean  Rhodes,  a  man  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">missed  opportunity  after  opportunity.  But  he  didn't  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">excuses for his shortcomings or whine about what might have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been.  He  kept  going.  Here's  what  I  mean.  Rhodes  met  Dave</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas long before the restaurateur opened his first Wendy's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rhodes  admitted  that  he  always  knew  the  young  Thomas</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  "someday  do  something  big."  But  when  given  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity to invest in Wendy's, he didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later, Rhodes met Colonel Sanders and had an opportunity</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  buy  stock  in  his  company  before  it  went  national.  But  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned that down as well because he didn't agree with some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the colonel's ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Rhodes was in the restaurant equipment business, he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>often had equipment salesmen in his office trying to sell him on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  machines.  One  of  them  was  Ray  Kroc.  Rhodes  admitted</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Kroc  was  a  pleasant  person.  However,  he  chose  not  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">invest in the little hamburger stand called McDonald's. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—NAPOLEON HILL</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  years  later,  on  a  cruise,  he  met  an  attorney  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pacific  Northwest  who  suggested  that  Rhodes  invest  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">son's new computer company. It had a funny name: Microsoft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rhodes declined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  people  would  pull  their  hair  out  and  complain  if  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">missed  only  one  of  those  opportunities,  making  excuses  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">why  it  didn't  work  out.  Not  Rhodes.  He  saw  his  mistakes  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they were and focused on pursuing his own dreams and</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities.  Eventually  he  saw  his  name  at  #289  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Forbes </i> list  of  the  400  most  successful  business  owners  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  matter  how  many  opportunities  you've  missed  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes you've made, don't ever make excuses. Bite the bullet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">take complete responsibility for yourself, and keep trying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Incentives: Develop Some</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  helps  a  person  remain  tenacious  like  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentive. That's why so many companies use them with their</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees. Walter Elliot said, "Perseverance is not a long race; </p>
<p class="calibre1">it is many short races, one after another." If you give yourself</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthwhile incentives to win the short races, attaining a long-</p>
<p class="calibre1">term goal seems less formidable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>As you develop incentives for yourself, keep these things in</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Reward yourself only  <i class="calibre4">after </i> you reach the goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• Divide the process into stages to multiply the rewards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  Include  others—that  increases  accountability  and  makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievement more enjoyable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  you  choose  to  use  as  incentives  is  up  to  you.  But</p>
<p class="calibre1">match the incentive to the goal. Just as a parent doesn't reward</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  child  for  finishing  his  vegetables  with  a  trip  to  Disneyland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">don't make rewards for the small objectives too big. Otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">you will undermine your desire to keep going. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Determination: Cultivate It</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Author  Napoleon  Hill  noted,  "Effort  only  fully  releases  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">reward after a person refuses to quit." To develop persistence</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the long haul, you have to cultivate inward determination</p>
<p class="calibre1">on a continual basis. And if you do, someday your story may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be similar to one of these:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Admiral  Peary  attempted  to  reach  the  North  Pole  seven  times  before  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">made it on try number eight. </p>

<p class="calibre1">before  one  word  was  ever  published—he  eventually  published  560  books, </p>

<p class="calibre1">with  stories  of  people  who  tried,  failed,  and  kept  going. And</p>

<p class="calibre1">shot is that the big shot kept shooting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A SURPRISE AT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHRISTMAS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I will always associate persistence with someone I got to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">in San Diego about ten years ago while I was the senior pastor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Skyline  Church.  I  first  met  him  at  a  performance  of  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas production. Those performances were always major</p>
<p class="calibre1">events. Each year we did twenty-four performances over three</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks  to  audiences  totaling  more  than  twenty  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I was backstage talking to some of the singers and actors</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  a  performance,  I  heard  them  excitedly  talking  to  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Orval's  here.  Orval  is  in  the  audience,"  I  could  hear  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying.  I  thought  that  was  nice.  Orval  Butcher  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">founding  pastor  of  Skyline,  and  I  was  glad  to  see  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people were excited about putting on a good show for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I stepped out in front of the people in the auditorium</p>
<p class="calibre1">to welcome them to the performance, I spotted someone sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the front row that I recognized. He was a tall, thin man with</p>
<p class="calibre1">wavy gray hair, glasses, suspenders, and a red bow tie. That's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>when  I  realized  that  they  hadn't  been  talking  about  Orval</p>
<p class="calibre1">Butcher—like  me,  they  had  seen  Orville  Redenbacher  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">audience! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">YOU'D NEVER GUESS FROM LOOKING AT HIM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  years,  I  got  to  know  Orville  Redenbacher.  He  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright and cheerful, just as he appeared to be on his television</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercials. And he was generous too. About twice a year, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">truck  would  pull  up  to  my  house,  and  the  men  would  unload</p>
<p class="calibre1">boxes of popcorn for me and my family—a gift from Orville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  people  who  saw  Orville  Redenbacher  on  television</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought he was an actor portraying a businessman. He seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">so quirky that people assumed that his persona was a made-up</p>
<p class="calibre1">character.  <i class="calibre4">Adweek  </i> described  him  as  "a  wry  caricature  sprung</p>
<p class="calibre1">from American Gothic,'an owlish codger with the deportment of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a life-long prom chapter one." But he was the genuine article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He personally developed the popcorn he sold, and how he did</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is a study in persistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">INDIANA FARM BOY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Redenbacher was born on a farm in Jackson Township, a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles south of Brazil, Indiana, in 1907. At age twelve, he started</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing popcorn in addition to doing his numerous chores. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,  his  additional  crop  brought  in  $150  a  month,  most  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which he set aside for college. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1924,  he  graduated  from  high  school,  the  first  person  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>his family to reach that milestone. He received an appointment</p>
<p class="calibre1">to West Point, but instead he went to Purdue. His ambition was</p>
<p class="calibre1">to become a county agent. Times were tough, and coming from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  farming  family  meant  that  he  didn't  have  much  money.  So</p>
<p class="calibre1">Redenbacher  worked  hard  and  did  lots  of  odd  jobs  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">university  in  the  agriculture  department,  including  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments with popcorn hybrids. Many times he considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">quitting, but he always persevered. In a letter to his fiancee, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote why he hadn't given up:</p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  I  always  wanted  my  children  to  know  I  was  a  college  graduate  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  I  was  afraid  people  back  home  would  think  I  couldn't  make  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">grades,  or  else  got  kicked  out  and  the  third  reason  was  because  I  told  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">folks that I was going to college . . . The first two summers I went home</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  full  intention  of  quitting,  but  these  other  things  got  to  working</p>
<p class="calibre1">and every fall found me back at Purdue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1928, he received his degree in agriculture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NEW OPPORTUNITIES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The first job Redenbacher took was as a teacher. But the next</p>
<p class="calibre1">year he became a county agent, a job he held until 1940 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  received  an  offer  from  the  Princeton  Mining  Company  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">manage  its  newly  acquired  Princeton  Farms.  At  twelve</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand  acres  it  was  the  largest  farm  in  Indiana.  There  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">again experimented with popcorn hybrids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  ten  years  Redenbacher  managed  Princetons  concerns</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  was  highly  successful.  But  in  1950,  he  and  his  friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlie  Bowman  decided  to  go  into  business  together, </p>
<p class="calibre1">purchasing the George F. Chester 8c Son Seed Company. Once</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>again, Redenbacher was highly successful, and again, he spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">lots of time developing his hybrid. To give you an idea of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnitude  of  that  task,  read  the  words  of  his  grandson,  Gary</p>
<p class="calibre1">Redenbacher:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa  was  a  tireless  worker.  The  effort  that  was  required  to  come  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  gourmet  hybrid  was  enough  work  for  anyone's  lifetime.  Those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  have  ever  tried  to  hybridize  a  rose,  or  any  other  plant,  know  that  it's</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  a  matter  of  dogged  determination  and  time.  I  tell  people  to  imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  are  in  a  football  stadium  full  of  fans.  Imagine  that  each  fan  is  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stalk  of  corn.  Your  job  is  to  go  to  each  cornstalk  in  the  stands  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">individually  pollinate  each  one.  But  since  the  average  football  stadium</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  holds  about  fifty  thousand  people,  you'll  need  to  do  three  stadiums</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  you've  pollinated  as  many  cornstalks  as  Grandpa  did  <i class="calibre4">each  year</i>... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  all  these  tens  of  thousands  of  hybrids,  Grandpa  never  lost  sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his goal: To produce a better popcorn. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SUCCESS AT LAST? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, in 1965, Redenbacher perfected his popcorn hybrid. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  a  popcorn  that  outperformed  every  other  variety  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">popping  volume,  pop-ability,  and  flavor.  But  his  battle  wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">over.  It  took  him  another  ten  years  to  make  his  popcorn  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best-selling brand in the world. And that's when he and Charlie</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bowman sold the brand to Hunt-Wesson Foods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would have been easy for Redenbacher to quit his quest</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  perfect  popcorn.  He  wasn't  successful  in  marketing  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">until he was sixty-seven years old. But he had a dream and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">determination  to  pursue  it.  And  he  wouldn't  give  up.  When</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked about his philosophy, he said, "I've followed the classic</p>
<p class="calibre1">homespun  principles.  Never  say  die.  Never  be  satisfied.  Be</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Y</b>ou  are  probably  familiar  with  this  quote  by  President  Calvin</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coolidge. McDonald's founder Ray Kroc used to quote it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  in  the  world  can  take  the  place  of  persistence.  Talent  will  not; </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  is  more  common  than  unsuccessful  men  with  talent.  Genius  will</p>

<p class="calibre1">is  full  of  educated  derelicts.  Persistence  and  determination  alone  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">omnipotent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,  I  would  have  to  disagree  with  that  statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Persistence is important, but it isn't the  <i class="calibre4">only </i> key to success. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  you  need  persistence  <i class="calibre4">plus </i> something  more.  It's  just  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  old  saying  about  boxers: A  champion  gets  up  one  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">time than he gets knocked down. Yet if that's the  <i class="calibre4">only </i> thing he</p>
<p class="calibre1">does,  he  may  finally  win,  but  not  before  getting  his  brains</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten out. Who wants that? He's much better off if he needs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  get  up  off  the  canvas  only  a  few  times.  He  does  that  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">figuring out how to knock out his opponent! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HE DIDN'T PLAY GAMES WITH SUCCESS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>That's  what  Milton  Bradley  what  to  do  so  that  he  wouldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue falling down. He started his career at age twenty as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">draftsman.  That  was  in  1856.  By  1860,  he  had  earned  enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">money to buy a printing press and go into business for himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a lithographer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  first  great  product  idea  was  for  a  lithograph  of  newly</p>
<p class="calibre1">elected President Abraham Lincoln. As soon as he offered the</p>
<p class="calibre1">print  for  sale,  the  orders  flooded  in. And  he  would  have  kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">making money except for one problem: His print was of a clean-</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaven  Lincoln,  but  the  new  president  had  grown  a  beard.  It</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly ruined Bradley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While he was trying to cope with his first major setback, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided  to  try  selling  something  different:  a  game.  When  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a child, his parents had used games as tools to teach him</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  his  siblings.  He  had  a  concept  for  a  game  he  called  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Checkered  Game  of  Life,  which  taught  moral  values.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">designed the game and printed up copies. It was the first parlor</p>
<p class="calibre1">game printed in the United States. The game sold well. In fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as fast as the handmade games could be produced, customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped  them  up.  That  first  year  he  sold  forty  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">copies! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A NEW FOCUS AND PLAN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That  first  success  gave  Bradley  a  new  direction  in  life.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned  his  attention  to  producing  games  and  other  materials</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  stimulated  the  mind  and  instructed  people  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertaining  them.  Primarily  that  meant  games.  But  it  wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">long  before  he  wanted  to  expand  more  intentionally  into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>educational  resources. A  new  concept  to America  had  come</p>
<p class="calibre1">across  the Atlantic  Ocean  from  Germany  called  kindergarten, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Bradley became very excited by it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bradley  saw  the  educational  potential  of  kindergarten  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">children  and  the  potential  market  for  materials  to  teach  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  to  be  the  first  person  in  America  to  print</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindergarten  materials  in  English.  He  wanted  to  produce</p>
<p class="calibre1">building  blocks,  art  supplies,  and  other  items.  He  intended  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make kindergarten materials his primary focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his business associates objected. Because the company</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  operating  in  an  economic  downturn,  they  believed  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">focusing  such  attention  in  a  risky  new  area  might  put  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">company out of business. Bradley was undeterred. He pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward  with  his  plan,  and  ultimately  he  achieved  remarkable</p>
<p class="calibre1">success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  took  all  the  faith  I  could  muster,"  said  Bradley,  "all  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">belief in the final triumph of kindergarten principles to pull me</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  those  early  years  of  discouragement,  when  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">business associates and other friends and the annual balance</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets of our bookkeeper were all against me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  time,  Bradley  became  one  of  kindergarten's  chief</p>
<p class="calibre1">proponents.  He  produced  numerous  materials  and  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">published  the  influential  journal  <i class="calibre4">Kindergarten  Review. </i> He</p>
<p class="calibre1">made a difference in the lives of thousands and thousands of</p>

<p class="calibre1">Maybe  you  have  developed  the  persistence  and  resilience  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  getting  up  when  you  get  knocked  down,  but  you're</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>getting  weary  of  dragging  yourself  back  onto  your  feet  again</p>
<p class="calibre1">and again without making any progress. You may be physically</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  emotionally  exhausted.  If  so,  you  need  to  do  more  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  get  back  up.  What  you  need  is  a  plan  that  will  help  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine  what  to  do  <i class="calibre4">after </i> you've  gotten  back  up.  Try  using</p>
<p class="calibre1">these steps based on the word  <i class="calibre4">FORWARD:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Finalize Your Goal</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  last  chapter,  I  wrote  about  the  importance  of  having</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose and developing a desire. The next step is to settle on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">definite goal you want to reach. The boxer in the ring who gets</p>
<p class="calibre1">back  up  has  this  goal:  knocking  out  his  opponent.  Milton</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bradley  had  this  goal:  to  produce  educational  products  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindergarten students. You need to determine what your goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">is. Recognize this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The goal shapes the plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The plan shapes the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The action achieves the results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The results bring success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  cannot  finalize  your  goal,  you  wont  be  able  to  turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">your failures into successes. George Matthew Adams asserts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  this  life,  we  get  only  those  things  for  which  we  hunt,  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">which we strive, and for which we are willing to sacrifice. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">better to aim for something you want—even though you miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">it—than to get something that you didn't aim to get, and which</p>
<p class="calibre1">you don't want! If we look long enough for what we want in life</p>
<p class="calibre1">we are almost sure to find it, no matter what that objective may</p>

<p class="calibre1">Championship-winning  NBA  coach  Pat  Riley  said,  "There</p>

<p class="calibre1">so  intensive  and  so  intuitive  that  it  could  be  called  one  from</p>

<p class="calibre1">the will to get back up, the intelligence to plan your comeback, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the courage to take action, know this: You will experience</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>never  finished.  Success  is  in  the  journey,  the  continual</p>

<p class="calibre1">comes from the teachings of his friend Mike's dad when he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing up. He said that the man, whom he called "rich dad," </p>
<p class="calibre1">loved Texas and Texans. Rich dad used to say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  really  want  to  learn  the  attitude  of  how  to  handle  risk,  losing  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure,  go  to  San  Antonio  and  visit  the  Alamo.  The  Alamo  is  a  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">story  of  brave  people  who  chose  to  fight,  knowing  there  was  no  hope  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success  against  overwhelming  odds.  They  chose  to  die  instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrendering. It's an inspiring story worthy of study; nonetheless, it's still</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  tragic  military  defeat.  They  got  their  butts  kicked. A  failure  if  you  will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  lost.  So  how  do  Texans  handle  failure?  They  still  shout, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Remember the Alamo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kiyosaki adds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  time  he  was  afraid  of  making  a  mistake,  or  losing  money,  he  told</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  story  .  .  .  Rich  dad  knew  that  failure  would  only  make  him  stronger</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  smarter  .  .  .  It  gave  him  the  courage  to  cross  the  line  when  others</p>

<p class="calibre1">kingdom,  but  became  part  of  the  British  Empire  in  1826.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  a  century,  it  remained  among  Britain's  holdings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted  only  by  a  time  of  Japanese  occupation  during</p>
<p class="calibre1">World War II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  war,  as  the  British  granted  independence  to  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  more  members  of  their  former  empire,  the  people  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Singapore began to think about their own independence. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>British were skeptical. Singapore had no natural resources and</p>
<p class="calibre1">no </p>
<p class="calibre1">experience </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The </p>
<p class="calibre1">people </p>
<p class="calibre1">desired</p>
<p class="calibre1">independence,  but  culturally  they  still  possessed  a  colonial</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind-set. And on top of that, racial prejudice was rampant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1959,  Singapore  was  granted  its  independence.  But  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">country  didn't  do  well.  That's  when  the  people  decided  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  best  hope  was  to  attach  themselves  to  Malaysia,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they did in 1963. But the Malaysians didn't get along well with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the people of Singapore, and after two years, Malaysia severed</p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  with  Singapore.  The  country's  leader,  Prime  Minister  Lee</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuan Yew, felt that the country had been cast adrift—with few</p>
<p class="calibre1">prospects  and  little  hope.  There  was  only  one  thing  to  do:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Work themselves out of their horrible situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOVING FORWARD WITH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A PLAN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee  wrestled  with  the  problem  until  he  had  a  plan.  He  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">young  leader—only  forty-two  years  old—and  unlike  most  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his countrymen, he was educated. He knew that a turnaround</p>
<p class="calibre1">was possible, but it would take a generation to do it. His goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">was to create First World conditions in a Third World country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is how he decided to do it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1 .  <i class="calibre4">Bring  in  industry. </i> His  first  objective  was  to  bring  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">industries that would employ many low-skilled workers so that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the people would have jobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  <i class="calibre4">Create public housing. </i> He wanted to improve the people's</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality  of  living  and  to  inspire  them.  They  would  move  into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>better housing, but they would pay for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  <i class="calibre4">Send  people  to  school. </i> The  only  way  for  the  country  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve  was  for  the  people  to  improve  themselves.  He  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">make education affordable for everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  <i class="calibre4">Set  up  a  bank ing  system. </i> The goal was nothing short of</p>
<p class="calibre1">making Singapore the financial center of Asia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.  <i class="calibre4">Encourage international travel. </i> Singapore would become</p>
<p class="calibre1">a business and tourist destination with a world-class airport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee's  goal  was  lofty  and  his  plan  ambitious.  It  would  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">utter determination to achieve what he dreamed, but even then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  would  need  help  in  accomplishing  it.  He  turned  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  Nations  for  assistance.  And  though  the  organization</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  willing  to  help,  things  didn't  go  smoothly  at  first.  Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert Winsemius, an industrial and economic adviser from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">U.N., visited the country and said, "It was bewildering. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  strikes  about  nothing.  There  was  a  riot  every  other  day</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  everywhere.  My  first  impression  was  anything  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopeful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Lee and the people of Singapore persevered. First, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">received  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  loans  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">World  Bank,  and  the  countries  of  England  and  Japan.  Next, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  brought  in  experts  from  around  the  world  to  help  them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully selecting representatives from countries who led their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fields:</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Japan and Germany: technical advisers to set up factories</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Sweden and Holland: experts on banking and financing</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Israel: army advisers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>• New Zealand and Australia: air force and naval advisers</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  they  brought  in  twelve  hundred  companies  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  and  Japan,  including  General  Electric,  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewlett-Packard,  Philips,  Sony,  Mitsubishi,  Caterpillar,  Texas</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instruments, Mobil Oil, and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SINGAPORE'S STORY IS HER STORY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  our  guide,  Susanna  Foo,  told  us  about  her  country,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">fought  back  the  tears.  She  had  been  one  of  the  struggling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">uneducated  people  that  the  country  had  helped  to  make  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">better life. As a teenager in the 1960s, she had dropped out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">high school. But as the country got on track, so did she. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">went back to night school and improved herself. Today, in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifties,  she  understands  the  incredible  distance  she  and  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">country have traveled. She has seen the city of Singapore go</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a land of swamp and scrub to a flourishing international</p>
<p class="calibre1">city.  And  she  has  seen  the  people  go  from  ignorant  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">helpless to a rugged, disciplined group of achievers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Singapore  continues  to  change.  The  people  continue  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve,  and  they  focus  a  lot  of  their  attention  on  giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">something  back.  "We  are  involved  in  helping  Bosnia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zimbabwe,  Turkey,  Vietnam,  East  Timor,  and  Kuwait,"  says</p>
<p class="calibre1">Susanna.  "It  is  our  turn  to  give  back.  And  because  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand  how  great  the  need  is,  we  are  willing  to  go</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherever the U.N. asks us to go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm not sure when I will get back to Singapore, but as I left, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">realized  that  I  would  not  forget  Susanna  Foo  or  her  beautiful</p>

<p class="calibre1">somebody that you consider to be a lot like you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let  me  introduce  you  to  a  friend  of  mine  named  Dave</p>

<p class="calibre1">out how many of the events in his life correspond to the steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">in failing forward that I've outlined in this book. </p>

<p class="calibre1">into  account  the  dozens  of  local  and  national  culinary  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  awards  Dave  has  received—or  his  accomplishments</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>as  a  silversmith  and  antique  collector.  Everything  Dave  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever  touched  has  turned  to  gold,  right?  Wrong!  To  really</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand and appreciate Dave's achievements,  you  need  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know more about his failures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A TYPICAL TEENAGER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When Dave Anderson graduated from high school in 1971, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  like  many  other  eighteen-year-old  kids.  He  wasn't  sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he wanted to do with his life. And if you had suggested</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  him  back  then  that  he  would  someday  be  a  successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman worth tens of millions of dollars making a positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">impact on the lives of thousands of people, he probably would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have thought you were crazy. Yet that's what has happened to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,  and  it's  all  because  he's  a  man  who  learned  how  to  <i class="calibre4">fail</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">forward. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave  grew  up  in  the  city  of  Chicago.  He  was  an  average</p>
<p class="calibre1">student,  and  when  he  got  out  of  school,  he  was  looking  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction.  He  wasn't  much  of  a  people  person,  so  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking  in  terms  of  rinding  a  career  where  he  could  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">outdoors  and  be  closer  to  nature.  Because  of  his  Native</p>
<p class="calibre1">American  heritage  (his  father  is  Choctaw  and  his  mother  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chippewa), he considered a career in wildlife and forestry. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">went to Michigan Tech University in Houghton, Michigan, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">started living the typical college experience—some class work</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  studying  during  the  week  with  lots  of  partying  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weekends. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a><b class="calibre3">OPPORTUNITY CAME</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CALLING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the break after his first term, he went back to Chicago to</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit his parents, and a friend called him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dave," he asked. "You got a suit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,  you  know  I  do,"  Dave  responded.  He'd  grown  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to church, and in those days that's what you wore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, put it on and I'll pick you up," his friend said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  then  Dave  was  ready  for  anything,  so  he  put  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit,  and  when  his  buddy  picked  him  up,  they  went  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting  recruiting  people  to  sell  an  oil  conditioner  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">automobile engines. Dave wasn't a mechanically inclined guy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  the  technical  part  of  the  presentation  didn't  connect  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. But he was really excited by the speaker, a fellow named</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zig  Ziglar,  who  told  him  and  the  other  men  and  women  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">attendance, "If you believe in yourself and have passion, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can succeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave  had  never  really  heard  anything  like  that  before  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">school or at home. His parents loved him, but they didn't know</p>
<p class="calibre1">much </p>
<p class="calibre1">about </p>
<p class="calibre1">positive </p>
<p class="calibre1">motivation </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">they </p>
<p class="calibre1">weren't</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs. His dad was a construction worker who worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard at his job and encouraged his son to do the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That night Dave went home and talked to his parents about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the opportunity of selling that product, and when the company</p>
<p class="calibre1">held its next meeting, Dave went back and took his dad along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  like  a  viable  opportunity  to  him,  and  he  certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted to see his son succeed. So he put $2,500 of his hard-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>earned money into buying the product for Dave to start him in</p>
<p class="calibre1">business. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DAVE'S FIRST BUSINESS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave never went back to Michigan Tech. For the first time in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his life, he had a dream, and he had bought into it 100 percent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  to  be  a  success  and  make  it  in  business.  For  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next few months, he worked as hard as he could to sell that oil</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditioner. But it was as if he'd hit a brick wall. No matter how</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard he tried, he couldn't make it work. It was his first business</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure.  Dave  says  that  as  far  as  he  knows,  his  dad  still  has  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few  cases  of  that  oil  conditioner  stockpiled  somewhere  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">garage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But contained within that first big failure were seeds of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">future success. (Step IS: Get up, get over it, get going.) First, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  hope.  He  believed  that  he  <i class="calibre4">could  be </i> successful.  (Step  6:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't let the failure from outside get inside you.) Second, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">his dad bought the product for him, Dave received a five-day</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership course that he says changed his life. (Step 10: Find</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  benefit  in  every  bad  experience.)  He  also  was  given  six</p>
<p class="calibre1">tapes  by  Zig  Ziglar.  Every  night  for  months,  Dave  went  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep  listening  to  those  tapes.  (Step  8:  Change  yourself,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">your world changes.) The dream within him wasn't dead. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">he wasn't going to let that failure get him down. (Step 1: Realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  is  one  major  difference  between  average  people  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving  people.)  He  just  wouldn't  realize  success  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">that business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After failing as an oil conditioner entrepreneur, Dave went to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work part-time selling sporting goods for Eddie Bauer. And in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>the fall of 1972, he enrolled in Roosevelt University in Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  next  several  years,  like  clockwork,  Dave  enrolled  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt in the fall and ended up with a bunch of zeros and</p>
<p class="calibre1">incompletes  on  his  transcript.  He  had  the  desire  to  improve</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,  but  a  weak  aptitude  for  school,  coupled  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ANOTHER VENTURE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also in 1972 that Dave got the idea for another business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  oil  additive  opportunity  didn't  work  for  him,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">encouraged him to start thinking like an entrepreneur. (Step 2:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Learn  a  new  definition  of  <i class="calibre4">failure.)</i>  His  idea  was  to  create  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sell miniature dish gardens. He scraped together a few dollars</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  bought  the  materials  to  make  up  a  few  samples.  Then  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went out and talked to retailers, trying to get them to buy them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave  had  his  first  bit  of  success  with  James  Ashner  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard Lange Florist. He told Dave, "These look good. Okay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">let me have a dozen of this one, a dozen of these, and a dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">of these," pointing to his favorites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave was stunned. "That's a lot of money," he said, quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">calculating the cost of materials in his head. "How about one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">each?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"  said  Ashner,  "I  want  a  dozen  of  these,  a  dozen  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these, and a dozen of this one too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  sure  you  don't  just  want  to  take  one  of  each?"  Dave</p>
<p class="calibre1">offered timidly. He figured that if he could sell and deliver a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his samples, he would have enough money to buy supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>"No," Ashner replied simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can't get you a dozen of each," Dave finally explained. "I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't have enough money to buy the materials to make them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,  you  look  like  an  honest  guy.  What  if  I  pay  you  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">front? Would that help?" Ashner answered. "Ann Marie," he</p>
<p class="calibre1">called  to  his  assistant  in  the  next  room,  "write  this  guy  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">check." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave  was  dumbfounded. A  few  minutes  later,  in  his  hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the largest check he'd ever held. It was for $736.35. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ANOTHER GAIN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the day Dave started his wholesale florist business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the next seven years, he operated out of his basement and</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  like  a  madman.  He  put  in  long  hours  seven  days  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week. When his retail florist customers experienced their heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">crunch  times  around  Mother's  Day  and  Valentine's  Day,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went into their shops, swept up, cleaned out coolers, and did</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  chores  to  help  them  out.  By  age  twenty-one,  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">accounts with every major retail florist in the city of Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By his late twenties, he felt like a tremendous success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around  that  time  a  florist  friend  had  an  idea  to  make  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">extra money. Back in the late seventies, students at universities</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked to decorate their dorm rooms and apartments with plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave's friend, whose son attended Southern Illinois University, </p>
<p class="calibre1">figured  that  they  could  buy  plants  cheap  from  the  grower  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Florida, rent space in the student union at the beginning of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall term, and sell the plants at a hefty profit. And that's what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>they  did.  They  drove  to  Florida  with  a  semi,  filled  it  up  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">plants, and brought them back. They were able to eliminate two</p>
<p class="calibre1">middlemen  from  the  process,  mark  the  plants  up  in  price,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">still  sell  them  for  much  less  than  the  usual  retail  price.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">made $20,000 in two days! (Step 11: If at first you do succeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">try something harder.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AND ANOTHER LOSS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  that  venture  had  brought  such  success,  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  to  try  it  again,  but  this  time  on  a  larger  scale. A  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kmart  was  scheduled  to  open  in  Pontiac,  Illinois,  in  October, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and they made arrangements to sell plants there. Dave and his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend  went  to  Florida  and  brought  back  two  semis  full  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">plants. They rented a big tent, filled it up with plants, and set</p>
<p class="calibre1">up four cash registers to wait on customers. But a funny thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened that day. A strange fog drifted in. Then it started to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drizzle. Before long, the drizzle turned into a steady rain. That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">when it suddenly turned cold. The rain became sleet and then</p>
<p class="calibre1">snow.  Winter  had  come  early,  and  the  tender  tropical  plants</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn't  take  it.  They  lost  everything.  The  venture  cost  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">the $20,000 they had made in the prior student sale plus other</p>
<p class="calibre1">money they had put into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you're  from  the  Midwest,  you  probably  remember  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">winter  of  1979.  It  was  one  of  the  worst  on  record.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">snowstorm that hit Chicago was horrible, and the drifts were so</p>
<p class="calibre1">high  that  many  side  streets  were  closed  <i class="calibre4">for  months. </i> A  lot  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">businesses  went  under  that  year—including  Dave's.  Florists</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't  buy  much  in  the  middle  of  a  blizzard.  Many  of  Dave's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>customers not only weren't buying from him, they also weren't</p>
<p class="calibre1">paying him the money they owed for orders they had already</p>
<p class="calibre1">received.  That,  coupled  with  the  huge  loss  at  Kmart,  put  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">under. He filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IN SEARCH OF NEW</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">STRENGTHS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Dave  lost  his  business,  he  needed  to  find  a  job  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">support  himself.  More  than  once  he  had  to  pawn  his  wife's</p>
<p class="calibre1">jewelry  to  pay  the  rent.  Twice  he  stood  in  line  to  file  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">unemployment, but he walked out, determined never to accept</p>
<p class="calibre1">a check from the government. He kept looking. Because he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">always  worked  for  himself,  he  wanted  to  find  something  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  allow  him  to  use  his  entrepreneurial  spirit.  But  he  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted  something  that  would  help  him  improve  himself.  All</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful people, he reasoned, had good people skills, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt  that  his  ability  to  work  with  people  still  needed  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengthened.  (Step  13:  Work  on  the  weakness  that  weakens</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.) Those two desires meant one thing: He needed to take a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sales job—and that scared him. His fear of failure in that area</p>
<p class="calibre1">was overwhelming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  landed  a  job  working  for  the  American  Can  Company, </p>
<p class="calibre1">selling  Dixie  cups,  Marathon  paper  towels,  and  tissue  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">restaurants. (Step 4: Take action and reduce your fear.) To get</p>
<p class="calibre1">his foot in the door, he took the worst territory. At night, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  family  was  out  of  the  house,  he  would  practice  talking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling,  and  even  shaking  hands  with  himself  in  front  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>mirror. During the day, he worked hard. He relied on the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">principles and tenacity he had in the wholesale floral industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Step  14:  Understand  there's  not  much  difference  between</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure  and  success.)  He  made  a  lot  of  mistakes,  experienced</p>
<p class="calibre1">much rejection, and lost many sales. But he worked like crazy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  kept  learning.  In  six  months,  he  took  a  territory  that  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been in last place and made it number one in the company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  learned  a  lot  in  that  position.  He  discovered  that  "you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to experience a lot of failure to achieve success. And the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more failure you go through, the higher your success." He also</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered that his past failure didn't brand him for life. (Step 3:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remove the "you" from failure.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After  I  lost  my  [wholesale  floral]  business,  I  went  back  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some of the companies I had worked with before," says Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All I could think about was the thousands of dollars I owed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them  when  I  filed  for  bankruptcy.  But  they  didn't  care  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">that. Their thought was, 'We wrote that off years ago. Besides, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we made a lot more than that from you during our years doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  together.'  [Step  7:  Say  good-bye  to  yesterday]  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">know,  if  you're  honest  and  admit  your  failures,  people  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty  forgiving.  People  want  to  help  you  if  you  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility for yourself." (Step 5: Change your response to</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure by accepting responsibility.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">OPPORTUNITY AGAIN? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1982,  Dave's  tribe,  the  Lac  Courte  Orielles  Lake  Superior</p>
<p class="calibre1">Band  of  Ojibwa  in  northwest  Wisconsin,  came  calling.  Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization  was  losing  money,  and  recognizing  his  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">prowess,  they  asked  him  to  be  their  CEO.  That  put  him  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>charge  of  a  variety  of  businesses  and  interests,  including  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cranberry marsh, a print shop, and a construction company. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">led the tribe's concerns for three years. During that time, gross</p>
<p class="calibre1">revenues increased from $3.9 million to more than $8 million. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  success  with  his  tribe  prompted  President  Reagan  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize  Dave  in  the  Commission  on  Indian  Reservation</p>
<p class="calibre1">Economies.  Various  state  and  local  government  and  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations  honored  him  and  asked  him  to  sit  on  numerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">councils  for  areas  such  as  tourism  and  minority  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">development.  In  time,  Dave  was  helping  so  many  people  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was granted a Bush Leadership Fellowship for a lifetime of</p>
<p class="calibre1">outstanding achievement by the Bush Foundation in St. Paul, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minnesota.  That's  how  he  got  into  Harvard—with  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">undergraduate degree and a transcript full of poor grades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After he graduated, he worked with the Mille Lacs Tribe for</p>
<p class="calibre1">several  years.  Dave  helped  them  create  thousands  of  jobs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing their previously devastating unemployment rate down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  nearly  zero,  and  helped  build  the  company  that  <i class="calibre4">Fortune</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">magazine  recognized  as  the  fastest  growing  in  America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Dave had achieved success in a variety of businesses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had not yet done anything related to his true passion: food. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PURSUING HIS LOVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave's love for food began when he was just a kid. His father</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  at  various  construction  sites  around  Chicago  as  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">electrician,  and  he  occasionally  brought  home  leftover  ribs</p>
<p class="calibre1">from one of the storefront barbecue shacks introduced to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  a  coworker. As  soon  as  Dave  tasted  his  first  rib,  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>hooked. And as soon as he was old enough to work, he started</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he calls "the quest for the perfect barbecue." Every place</p>
<p class="calibre1">he traveled to around the country for business, he talked to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">locals to find out where the best restaurants were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've traveled the back roads and side streets of this country</p>
<p class="calibre1">searching  for  great-tasting  food,"  says  Dave  enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been everywhere from storefront kitchens down inner-city</p>
<p class="calibre1">side streets to country road houses to fine dining restaurants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I'd  go  to  a  convention,  after  fulfilling  my  company</p>
<p class="calibre1">obligations,  I'd  disappear,  and  my  coworkers  would  wonder</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  I  was.  I  was  in  the  best  little  restaurants  in  town.  I'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">order everything on the menu and taste it all. Then I'd go home</p>
<p class="calibre1">and experiment in my own kitchen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1994,  Dave  cofounded  a  highly  successful  restaurant</p>
<p class="calibre1">company called the Rain Forest Cafe, and it made him wealthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used some of the money he made to purchase a small resort</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Hayward, Wisconsin. There Dave built the kind of restaurant</p>
<p class="calibre1">he'd always dreamed of having: one that made great barbecue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was going to call it Dave's Famous Barbecue, but the printer</p>
<p class="calibre1">made  a  mistake  and  printed <b class="calibre3">FAMOUS  DAVE'S  </b>and  the  name</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck. The restaurant was a huge success. Soon he opened a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second Famous Dave's, then another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  this  point,  if  you  didn't  know  better,  you'd  think  Dave</p>
<p class="calibre1">was set. But he was on the verge of facing the lowest point of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his life and his greatest obstacle—himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HE GOT THE TREATMENT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1995, a group of friends and family came to Dave in what's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>commonly  called  an  intervention.  In  other  words,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">confronted  him  about  his  drinking.  Dave  had  started  drinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  college,  as  many  people  do.  But  he  didn't  leave  it  behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he moved into the business world. When the people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved  him  called  him  on  the  carpet,  he  was  secretly  pleased</p>
<p class="calibre1">because he knew he needed to change. He went into treatment</p>
<p class="calibre1">for alcoholism, and he's been sober ever since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The key to making it through treatment and succeeding is</p>
<p class="calibre1">accepting that you have a problem—that you drink too much</p>
<p class="calibre1">—accepting where you are, and moving on from there," Dave</p>
<p class="calibre1">asserts. "The people who go through treatment and don't stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">sober  fail  because  they  believe  they're  right.  They  won't  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility for themselves. The key to change is surrender." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave knew he needed to change, and in the years since he</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned  his  life  around,  he  has  seen  lots  of  change  in  himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now continual learning and growth are the hallmarks of his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Step  12:  Learn  from  a  bad  experience  and  make  it  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  realized  that  I  couldn't  hang  around  with  my  drinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends and change," he says. "If I went back to the bar where I</p>
<p class="calibre1">used  to  drink,  I  know  the  same  people  would  still  be  there</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting in the same places. They wouldn't have changed a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I've changed a  <i class="calibre4">lot </i> in four years." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IT'S NOT ABOUT DAVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  write  this,  Dave  owns  twenty-four  restaurants  in  five</p>
<p class="calibre1">states. And  the  business  is  still  growing.  But  to  succeed,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">has had to overcome a lot of obstacles—and a lot of doubters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Famous Dave's Corporate Growth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a><img src="index-258_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">"When  I  got  started,  people  told  me  that  my  restaurants</p>
<p class="calibre1">would never go in this part of the country," says Dave. "They</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,  'Minneapolis  is  not  a  barbecue  town.  It'll  never</p>
<p class="calibre1">work.'Well, today I've got thirteen restaurants in Minneapolis." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As incredible as Daves achievement has been, what's even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more remarkable is his realization that his success exists not for</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself  alone,  but  for  others.  He's  doing  that  through  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mino-Giizhig  Endowment  Fund  for  Disadvantaged  Minority</p>
<p class="calibre1">Children, which he founded, and also through Famous Dave's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He confirms, "Our business is more about changing lives than</p>
<p class="calibre1">selling  ribs."  (Step  9:  Get  over  yourself  and  start  giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">To succeed, you have to be open to problems. You have to be open to failure. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">And as you go up the ladder, you gain the right to get more problems. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a> <i class="calibre4">—DAVE ANDERSON</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To help him accomplish that, Dave developed Hog Heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">University  where  he  trains  his  people.  There  new  managers</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn  skills,  techniques,  and  information  that  will  help  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed at Famous Dave's, such as what Dave calls the trinity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of barbecue: meat, smoke, and sauce. But they learn something</p>
<p class="calibre1">else that's much more important. Dave tells all of them, "This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not about Dave Anderson. This is  <i class="calibre4">your </i> opportunity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  key  part  of  that  opportunity  is  knowing  how  to  fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward.  Dave  explains,  "Schools  teach  the  technical</p>
<p class="calibre1">disciplines  such  as  math  and  science,  but  not  about  mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">health. What they need to teach is how to deal with problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  day  you're  going  to  get  whacked  and  thumped  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems. Some of us get jackhammered. But to succeed, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to be open to problems. You have to be open to failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  as  you  go  up  the  ladder,  you  gain  the  right  to  get  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems. The higher you go, the bigger the problems. But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  effective  people  have  gone  through  the  toughest  times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They say you don't become a great sailor by sailing calm seas." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seas definitely haven't been calm for Dave in the past, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor will they be calm in the future. But that doesn't bother him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obstacles  are  just  opportunities.  Dave  emphasizes,  "I  tell  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees all the time: 'Most people run from problems. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want  to  get  ahead,  go  to  your  manager,  and  say,  "You  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems?  Give  me  some."  Instead  of  running  from  problems</p>
<p class="calibre1">like most people, go after them. If you do, I'll guarantee, it will</p>
<p class="calibre1">change  your  life!'  That's  the  way  you  get  ahead,  by  solving</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a><b class="calibre3">NOW YOU'RE READY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave  Anderson  has  made  more  mistakes,  suffered  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversity,  overcome  more  problems,  and  experienced  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">failures  than  most  people  you'll  ever  meet.  But  he  has  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieved  more. And  as  my  friend  Zig  Ziglar  declares,  "Dave</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anderson is just getting started." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  time  you  find  yourself  envying  what  successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">people have achieved, recognize that they have probably gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">through many negative experiences that you cannot see on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface. An old joke goes like this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never ask what's in a hot dog while you're eating one." The</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea is that if you did know what's in it, you'd never want to eat</p>
<p class="calibre1">one again. A lot of failure goes into success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  really  want  to  achieve  your  dreams—I  mean  <i class="calibre4">really</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve  them,  not  just  daydream  or  talk  about  them—you've</p>
<p class="calibre1">got to get out there and fail. Fail early, fail often, but always fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward. Turn your mistakes into stepping-stones for success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I was finishing this book, I sent Dave the first draft of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">story  so  that  he  could  make  sure  that  I'd  gotten  the  details</p>
<p class="calibre1">right. A few days later, he sent a note. It said, "I've never seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">my life story so laid out before. It's a wonder I never gave up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that you know how to fail forward, you won't have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give up either. I wish you well. Keep dreaming, and keep failing</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward. </p>
