<p class="calibre1">somebody else's fault. And as a result, they generally respond</p>
<p class="calibre1">in one or more of the following ways:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Blow Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One  reaction  to  failure  that  keeps  people  driving  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure freeway is anger. You've probably seen it. People make a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minor  mistake  and  angrily  overreact  to  it,  taking  out  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">frustration on themselves or others around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unchecked anger makes a small problem bigger. Nineteenth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  English  author  Charles  Buxton  summed  it  up:  "Bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">temper  is  its  own  scourge.  Few  things  are  more  bitter  than  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel  bitter.  A  man's  venom  poisons  himself  more  than  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">victim."  If  a  person  doesn't  govern  his  temper,  it  will  govern</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Cover Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It's in the nature of people to try to cover up their mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  tendency  is  as  old  as Adam  and  Eve  in  the  Garden  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden—and it's usually just as successful for us today as it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Don't waste energy trying to cover up failure. Learn from your failures and go</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">—H. STANLEY JUDD</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard a joke about a young navy pilot on maneuvers that</p>
<p class="calibre1">shows  how  people  often  react  to  their  mistakes.  Prior  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">takeoff,  the  commanding  admiral  had  ordered  absolute  radio</p>
<p class="calibre1">silence  from  everyone  engaged  in  the  exercise.  But  one  pilot</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakenly turned on his radio and was heard to mutter, "Boy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">am I fouled up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The admiral grabbed the mike from a radio operator and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will  the  pilot  who  broke  the  radio  silence  identify  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence, and then a voice was heard over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the radio: "I may be fouled up, but I'm not  <i class="calibre4">that </i> fouled up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">People's desire to make sure others don't see their mistakes</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn't  always  so  humorous.  For  example,  take  the  case  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nicholas Leeson. In 1995, the twenty-eight-year-old worked for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  British  bank  Barings.  He  controlled  huge  amounts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">money for the organization, which he tried to increase through</p>
<p class="calibre1">what's  been  called  casino-style  investing.  When  Leeson's</p>
<p class="calibre1">dealings resulted in huge losses, he covered them up and made</p>
<p class="calibre1">even riskier trades to try to recoup his losses. Analysts said it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  like  betting  double  or  nothing  in  a  gambling  game.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem  was  that  Leeson  kept  coming  up  with  nothing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating  bigger  and  bigger  losses.  Ultimately  his  actions  cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barings $1.3  <i class="calibre4">billion. </i> He single-handedly put one of the oldest</p>
<p class="calibre1">banks in the world out of business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">H. Stanley Judd said, "Don't waste energy trying to cover up</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure.  Learn  from  your  failures  and  go  on  to  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>challenge.  It's  okay  to  fail.  If  you're  not  failing,  you're  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing."  Anyone  who  wants  to  get  off  the  failure  freeway</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs to 'fess up rather than cover up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Speed Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Particularly  stubborn  people  sometimes  try  to  leave  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubles  behind  by  working  harder  and  faster,  but  without</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing  their  direction.  They're  like  the  person  trying  to  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the square peg in the round hole who first tries to place the peg</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the hole, then tries to shove it in, then takes a hammer and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries to pound it in. They're working hard but getting nowhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Too many people, when they make a mistake, just keep stubbornly plowing</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">ahead and end up repeating the same mistakes. I believe in the motto, "Try and</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—WILLIAM DEAN SINGLETON</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">William Dean Singleton, co-owner of MediaNews Group Inc., </p>
<p class="calibre1">addresses this tendency: "Too many people, when they make a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistake,  just  keep  stubbornly  plowing  ahead  and  end  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeating the same mistakes. I believe in the motto, Try and try</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.' But the way I read it, it says, Try, then stop and think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then try again.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Back  Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Have  you  ever  been  talking  with  someone  who  made  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtless  remark  during  a  conversation,  and  as  soon  as  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said  it,  you  could  tell  he  knew  he  had  made  a  mistake?  Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  you  called  him  on  it,  he  refused  to  admit  it.  No  matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  you  said,  he  kept  backing  up  and  trying  to  justify  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>remark,  which  made  him  look  sillier  and  sillier.  That's  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">people who back up do. And if they make a habit of it, they get</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck on the failure freeway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  my  wife,  Margaret,  and  I  were  raising  our  children, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth and Joel Porter (both of whom are now married), we</p>
<p class="calibre1">found that our son had a mind and will of his own. When he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did something wrong, his first move was to lie. Then he'd back</p>
<p class="calibre1">up  and  try  to  cover  it  up.  I  can  still  picture  his  offended</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression  as  he  emphatically  denied  having  eaten  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate  candy—with  his  nine-year-old  face  smeared  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate.  Margaret  and  I  worked  very  hard  to  break  him  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that inclination. </p>

<p class="calibre1">General Peyton C. March perceived, "Any man worth his salt</p>
<p class="calibre1">will  stick  up  for  what  he  believes  right,  but  it  takes  a  slightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">bigger  man  to  acknowledge  instantly  and  without  reservation</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he is in error." I'm relieved that today my boy Joel is a man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  when  he's  wrong,  he  admits  it. And  that's  good  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobody can exit off the failure freeway if he keeps backing up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Give Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  stay  on  the  failure  freeway  long  enough,  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually  <i class="calibre4">slow  up. </i>  It's  similar  to  what  happens  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interstate  285  loop  around  my  hometown  of  Atlanta  at  rush</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>simply quit." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUT TO FAIL FORWARD,YOU'VE GOT TO  <i class="calibre4">WAKE UP</i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There's  really  only  one  solution  to  the  gridlock  on  the  failure</p>
<p class="calibre1">freeway, and that's to wake up and find the exit. To leave the</p>
<p class="calibre1">road  of  continual  failure,  a  person  must  first  utter  the  three</p>
<p class="calibre1">most difficult words to say: "I was wrong." He has to open his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes, admit his mistakes, and accept complete responsibility for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  current  wrong  actions  and  attitudes.  Every  failure  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience is a fork in the road. It's an opportunity to take the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right action, learn from your mistakes, and begin again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leadership expert Peter Drucker says, "The better a man is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the more mistakes he will make, for the more new things he will</p>
<p class="calibre1">try.  I  would  never  promote  to  a  top-level  job  a  man  who  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not making mistakes . . . otherwise he is sure to be mediocre." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mistakes really do pave the road to achievement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here  is  an  acronym  I  created  to  help  me  keep  mistakes  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective. Mistakes are . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Messages that give us feedback about life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interruptions that should cause us to reflect and think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signposts that direct us to the right path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tests that push us toward greater maturity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awakenings that keep us in the game mentally. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Keys </b></i> that we can use to unlock the next door of opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explorations that let us journey where we've never been before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statements about our development and progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  years  ago  as  I  spoke  at  an  event  attended  by  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  fifty  thousand  people,  I  shared  something  written  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Portia Nelson. It has been one of the most-requested pieces by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>people who have heard me speak. It's called "Autobiography in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  Short  Chapters."  Better  than  almost  anything  else,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">describes the process of exiting the failure freeway:</p>

<p class="calibre1">pretend I don't see it. I fall in again. I can't believe I am in the same place, </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  only  way  to  exit  the  failure  freeway  and  see  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory  of  achievement  is  to  take  full  responsibility  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself  and  your  mistakes.  Michael  Korda,  editor  in  chief  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon  and  Schuster,  declared,  "Success  on  any  major  scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">requires you to accept responsibility . . . In the final analysis, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre3">YOUR MOST IMPORTANT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ABILITY:RESPONSIBILITY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fight to take responsibility occurs within. And rarely does</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent,  intelligence,  or  opportunity  make  the  difference  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether a person wins that battle. It calls for character. That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">why Stewart B. Johnson remarked, "Our business in life is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves—to break</p>
<p class="calibre1">our own records, to outstrip our yesterday by our today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  can  tell  when  people  develop  deeper  character,  accept</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility  for  themselves,  and  begin  learning  from  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">failures.  It  really  shows  in  their  performance.  For  example,  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">observed that in Chris Chandler of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons</p>
<p class="calibre1">after I moved to Georgia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chandler is a quarterback who had a history of floating from</p>
<p class="calibre1">team  to  team.  Prior  to  his  employment  with  Atlanta,  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">played for five teams in nine years, and he had never excelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  everything  started  to  change  for  him  in  Phoenix.  That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">where he met Jerry Rhome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  was  at  a  point  where  I  really  didn't  care  anymore,"  says</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chandler about that part of his career. His view of the league</p>
<p class="calibre1">affected his willingness to take full responsibility for his lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">success. "I thought the NFL was just totally political, and I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready to quit. Jerry brought back my competitiveness, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">taught me how to play. He made it fun again." <a href="index_split_003.html#p266">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">How did Rhome accomplish that? He told Chandler the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I told him after the season that he had a lot of ability, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  uncoachable,"  said  Rhome,  "and  I  offered  to  work  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>At  first  Chandler  resisted.  He  expected  everyone  else  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjust  to  his  style  and  ability.  But  then  he  changed  his  mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">and accepted Rhome's offer. With help, hard work, and a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">willingness  to  change  himself  rather  than  expecting  others  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change, Chandler has become one of the best quarterbacks in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the NFL, taking his team to the Super Bowl in 1999. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ANOTHER ROAD TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FAME</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Not everyone learns the lesson of accepting responsibility for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  actions.  One  of  the  most  unusual  stories  I've  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">encountered  about  someone  on  the  failure  freeway  is  that  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosie Ruiz. Back in 1980, she was the first woman to cross the</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish  line  of  the  Boston  Marathon  with  the  third-fastest</p>
<p class="calibre1">women's time ever. But from the moment that she finished the</p>
<p class="calibre1">race, people were suspicious of her "victory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  person  most  shocked  was  Jacqueline  Gareau.  Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">not favored to win the race, Gareau had been training to run it</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  three  years. And  during  the  course  of  the  race,  she  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled ahead of all the other women. It appeared that she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  to  win.  But  about  a  mile  from  the  finish  line,  another</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman  suddenly  appeared  running  ahead  of  her.  And  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">other woman—Ruiz—finished before her and was declared the</p>
<p class="calibre1">women's winner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately there was a stir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  knew  something  was  fishy,"  said  men's  winner  Bill</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rodgers.  He  said  that  Ruiz  had  too  much  body  fat  and  not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>enough muscle to be a distance runner. On top of that, at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish line she didn't appear fatigued, wasn't sweating heavily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  displayed  unfamiliarity  with  running  terminology  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">being interviewed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  race  officials  were  suspicious,  and  they  began  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigate. They found that, Ruiz had qualified for the Boston</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marathon  by  obtaining  a  fraudulent  qualifying  finish  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  Marathon.  They  surmised  that  in  the  Boston  race, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruiz had jumped into a group of runners a mile from the finish</p>
<p class="calibre1">line,  never  suspecting  that  she  was  actually  ahead  of  all  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  women.  The  Boston  Athletic  Association  disqualified</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, and a week later, they awarded Gareau the winner's medal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">STILL ON THE FREEWAY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">What's most amazing is that even years later, Ruiz still hadn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  from  her  mistake.  At  a  ten-kilometer  race  in  Miami, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gareau saw Ruiz and tried to talk to her to clear the air. Gareau</p>
<p class="calibre1">recounted: "I said, 'Why did you do that in Boston?' And she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, 'Oh, I did run it.' So, there's no way you're going to have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation with her." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">of our responsibilities. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—SIR JOSIAH STAMP</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  years  after  her  appearance  in  the  Boston  Marathon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruiz  was  arrested  and  charged  with  stealing  cash  and  checks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>from her employer. A year later she was convicted for trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sell two kilos of cocaine to an undercover police officer. <a href="index_split_003.html#p266">3 </a>As Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Josiah Stamp said, "It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">we cannot dodge the consequences of our responsibilities." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  don't  know  what  Rosie  Ruiz  is  doing  today.  Her  past</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities remind me of the bumper sticker I've seen that says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't follow me. I'm lost." Back then, Ruiz was doing a lot of</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving,  but  she  wasn't  getting  anywhere.  Let's  hope  she's</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally found the exit off the failure freeway. </p>

<p class="calibre1">always an inside job. Let me illustrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the spring of 1999, my publisher, Thomas Nelson, invited</p>
<p class="calibre1">me  to  speak  at  various  cities  around  the  country  on  a  book</p>
<p class="calibre1">tour. One of my stops on that trip was in Lexington, Kentucky, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  it  was  there  that  I  met  Greg  Horn,  owner  of  the  Payless</p>
<p class="calibre1">Food Center, a grocery store in Cynthiana, Kentucky. Greg told</p>
<p class="calibre1">me an incredible story that shows that no matter what happens</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">to </i> you, the important thing is what happens  <i class="calibre4">in </i> you. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">KEEPING HIS HEAD (AND HEART) ABOVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a><b class="calibre3">WATER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On March 1, 1997, Greg was in Bossier City, Louisiana, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had traveled from his home in Kentucky to attend my two-</p>
<p class="calibre1">day leadership conference. When the conference was over, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">boarded a plane and headed to St. Louis on the first leg of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">journey home, excitedly considering how to put into action the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership training he had received. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he got to the gate in St. Louis for his connecting flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Lexington,  he  was  surprised  to  discover  that  it  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">delayed because of bad weather in Kentucky. When that delay</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned  into  a  canceled  flight,  Greg  was  stuck  in  St.  Louis</p>
<p class="calibre1">overnight.  He  didn't  think  too  much  of  it.  He  was  a  seasoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">traveler and had learned to roll with the punches when on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">road. And the next morning, he caught the first flight out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  when  he  landed  in  Lexington  did  he  realize  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnitude of the problems caused by the weather. As he drove</p>
<p class="calibre1">north from the airport toward Cynthiana, he started to see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">effects of the heavy rain that had canceled his flight. When he</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  that  the  Licking  River,  which  flowed  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthiana, had flooded its banks, he started to worry about his</p>
<p class="calibre1">store.  He  headed  straight  for  it,  wanting  to  make  sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything  was  all  right.  The  thirty-mile  trip  seemed  to  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AND THE BAD NEWS IS . .. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When Greg finally arrived, he found the area flooded. Standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">two hundred yards away from his store, he could see only its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>roof  and  the  sign:  PAYLESS  FOOD  CENTER.  The  rest  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">under water. Demoralized, he headed for home, but he couldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">get anywhere near his house either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  three  days  Greg  stayed  with  his  sister  in  Lexington, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting  for  the  water  to  subside  and  wondering  what  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  to  do.  That's  when  he  called  his  insurance  agent  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  news  that  made  things  even  worse:  He  had  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind  of  insurance  except—you  guessed  it—flood  coverage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There would be no financial relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WEIGHING THE DAMAGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All in all, five days passed before Greg could get into the store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  when  he  opened  the  doors,  he  faced  complete</p>
<p class="calibre1">devastation.  He  stood  in  the  midst  of  $500,000  worth  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">waterlogged,  spoiled  inventory.  His  electronic  cash  registers</p>
<p class="calibre1">were full of filthy water, and a huge five-hundred-pound freezer</p>
<p class="calibre1">that usually held bags of ice had been lifted by the floodwaters</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  dumped  on  top  of  a  checkout  stand.  It  was  the  kind  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">demoralizing mess that makes a person want to lock the doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">and walk away forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At  that  point  I  had  a  choice,"  says  Greg.  He  could  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">given up, acknowledging that tragedy had caused his business</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  fail."I  could  have  filed  for  bankruptcy.  But  I  didn't  want  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do  that.  That's  when  the  principles  that  I  had  learned  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">days earlier at the leadership conference came back to me: It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  what  happens  <i class="calibre4">t o </i> me;  it's  what  happens  <i class="calibre4">i n </i> me. It's not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">size of the problem, but how I handle the problem. When I fall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  getting  up.  I  was  determined  to  overcome  this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>experience," adds Greg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He assessed that the building was still structurally solid, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the interior of the store was trashed. Everything inside had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be removed by hand. It took twenty-two truckloads to haul off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ruined inventory. All the cash registers had to be replaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So did the tile floor. He and his staff worked feverishly around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  clock.  It  cost  Greg  $1  million  to  do  it,  but  he  was  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reopen his Payless Food Center-—and he did it in a miraculous</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteen  days.  The  store  was  closed  for  only  twenty-one  days</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the flood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ASSESSING THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">How does a person assess the impact of an event like the flood</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  ruined  Greg  Horn's  store?  You  can  measure  it  in  dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  can  measure  it  in  days.  You  can  gauge  the  emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">impact  on  the  owner.  But  Greg  would  encourage  you  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure it in the lives of other people: "Being able to reopen in</p>
<p class="calibre1">only twenty-one days allowed eighty people to return to work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many of whom were personally affected by the flood. And as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">says in Proverbs, 'Humility comes before honor.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greg Horn is a great example of a person who learned how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fail forward. Many people desire to control the circumstances</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  their  lives,  but  the  truth  is  that  we  cannot  determine  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">will come our way. We cant control the hands we're dealt, only</p>
<p class="calibre1">how  we  play  the  cards.  That's  what  Greg  did.  He  could  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">made  the  flood  a  tombstone  for  his  store  and  his  career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, he turned it into a stepping-stone—for his employees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his community, and himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>"I got into the grocery business because I wanted to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">an impact on people," says Greg. "Before I opened the store in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthiana,  I  worked  for  Hershey's  Chocolate  and  had  a  $1.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">million  territory.  I  was  making  a  good  living,  but  that  wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  time  of  the  flood,  he  has  received  numerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">awards and has been recognized as the businessperson of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year  by  his  local  chamber  of  commerce. And  he  is  using  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative  experience  of  the  flood  to  begin  a  career  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivational  speaking.  Almost  every  week  Greg  publicly</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicates his message of encouragement to others. <a href="index_split_003.html#p267">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">A man is not defeated by his opponents but by himself. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">—JAN CHRISTIAAN SMUTS</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">South  African  general  Jan  Christiaan  Smuts  declared,  "A</p>
<p class="calibre1">man is not defeated by his opponents but by himself." That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">true.  No  matter  how  daunting  the  circumstances  of  your  life</p>
<p class="calibre1">may be, the greatest battle you wage against failure occurs on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the inside, not the outside. How do you fight that battle? You</p>
<p class="calibre1">start by cultivating the right attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">How You SEE Is WHAT You GET</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">You're  probably  familiar  with  Murphy's  Law,  which  says,  "If</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything  bad  can  happen,  it  will—and  at  the  worst  possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">time." And then there's the Peter Principle, which says, "People</p>
<p class="calibre1">always  rise  to  the  level  of  their  incompetence."  (By  the  way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both were written by pessimists!) A similar saying is the law of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>human behavior: "Sooner or later we get just what we expect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have a question to ask you: Is the law of human behavior</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic or pessimistic? Stop and think about your answer. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">say  that  because  your  response  reveals  your  attitude.  If  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect the worst out of life, then you probably said the law was</p>
<p class="calibre1">written by a pessimist. If you have a positive outlook, then you</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably answered "optimist" because the prospect of getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  you  expect  is  encouraging  to  you.  Your  attitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">determines your outlook. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">POSITIVE ATTITUDE: THE FIRST KEY TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHAT HAPPENS IN YOU</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  element  outlook.  University  of  Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychology  professor  Martin  Seligman,  who  has  studied</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees in thirty different industries, observes, "The people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who bounce back are optimists." <a href="index_split_003.html#p267">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's  face  it.  Not  everyone  is  naturally  optimistic.  Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  are  born  seeing  the  glass  half  empty  rather  than  half</p>
<p class="calibre1">full. But no matter what your natural bent is, you can become a</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  optimistic  person.  How  do  you  cultivate  optimism?  By</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning the secret of contentment. If you can learn that, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">no matter what happens to you, you can weather the storm and</p>
<p class="calibre1">build on the good you find in any situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contentment. That's not a popular concept these days. One</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason  is  that  our  culture  actually  discourages  the  idea  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">contentment.  People  are  continually  bombarded  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">message,  "What  you  have  isn't  enough.  You  need  more—a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>bigger house, a better car, a larger salary, whiter teeth, sweeter</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath, nicer clothes . . . " The list is endless. But the truth is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that possessing healthy contentment is essential to being able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to withstand failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  a  lot  of  misconceptions  about  contentment.  Let's</p>
<p class="calibre1">look at what it's  <i class="calibre4">not:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Not </i><b class="calibre3">Containing </b> <i class="calibre4">Your Emotions</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We all experience negative emotions. How do you think Greg</p>
<p class="calibre1">Horn felt when he saw his store six feet under water? Although</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  don't  want  to  let  your  emotions  run  amok,  you  shouldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">try  to  stuff  them  either.  Denial  doesn't  help  you  become</p>
<p class="calibre1">content.  Your  emotions  will  come  out  eventually,  even  if  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to bury them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  try  suppressing  your  emotions  as  a  strategy  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">attaining  contentment,  you  might  end  up  like  the  older  man</p>
<p class="calibre1">who lay in the hospital on the verge of death. As he floated on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the verge of consciousness for two weeks, his faithful wife sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a chair by him every moment. When he finally became lucid</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to speak, he whispered, "Honey, you have been with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me through all the bad times. When I got fired, you were there</p>
<p class="calibre1">to support me. When we lost the house, you never left my side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were there when I lost the business, and when my health</p>
<p class="calibre1">started failing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, dear," she answered, smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know what?" he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, dear?" she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're bad luck!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stuffing your emotions will not lead to contentment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Not </i> Maintaining  <i class="calibre4">Your Current Situation</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>My dad, who was a pastor for many years, used to tell the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story  about  a  farmer  in  one  of  his  churches  who  refused  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve  himself.  Dad  would  try  to  encourage  and  cajole  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but he said the man just wouldn't change. His response to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father was always the same:"I'm not making much progress, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm well established." </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day my father was driving past that man's farm, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  that  the  farmer's  tractor  was  stuck  in  the  mud.  No  matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">what the man did, mud flew, and the tractor stayed put. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the farmer gave it one more try and was no better off</p>
<p class="calibre1">than he had been before, he started cussing up a storm. At that</p>
<p class="calibre1">point, my dad rolled down his window and hollered out to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man,  "Well,  you're  not  making  much  progress,  but  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly are well established." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being  content  doesn't  mean  being  satisfied  with  a  bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation. It simply means having a good attitude as you work</p>
<p class="calibre1">your way out of it. When Greg Horn found his store flooded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he didn't give up, and he didn't give in. He made the best of it</p>
<p class="calibre1">and worked his way forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Not </i> Attaining  <i class="calibre4">Position, Power, or Possessions</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  our  culture,  too  many  people  believe  that  contentment</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes  from  attaining  material  possessions  or  positions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">power.  But  they  aren't  the  keys  to  contentment  either.  If  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  tempted  to  believe  that  they  are,  remember  the  words  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">John  D.  Rockefeller.  When  a  journalist  asked  him  how  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth was enough, the millionaire, who was at the time one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  richest  and  most  powerful  men  in  the  world,  answered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just a little more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contentment comes from having a positive attitude. It means</p>
<p class="calibre1">• expecting the best in everything—not the worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>• remaining upbeat—even when you get beat up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• seeing solutions in every problem—not problems in every</p>
<p class="calibre1">solution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  believing  in  yourself—even  when  others  believe  you've</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">• holding on to hope—even when others say it's hopeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter what happens to you, a positive attitude comes from</p>
<p class="calibre1">within.  Your  circumstances  and  your  contentment  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">unrelated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">POSITIVE ACTION: THE OTHER KEY TO WHAT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HAPPENS IN YOU</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">You  cannot  win  the  internal  battle  against  failure  without  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive  attitude  that  contentment  provides.  But  if  you  think</p>
<p class="calibre1">positively and do nothing, you will not be able to fail  <i class="calibre4">forward. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">You must add positive action to a positive attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">A problem is something that can be solved. A fact of life is something that</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">must be accepted. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  people  get  into  trouble  because  they  focus  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention  on  things  beyond  their  control.  Leadership  expert</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred Smith says that the key to positive action is to know the</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference  between  a  problem  and  a  fact  of  life. A  problem  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that can be solved. A fact of life is something that</p>
<p class="calibre1">must be accepted. For example, for Greg Horn, the flood was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact.  He  didn't  waste  his  time  wondering  what  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened  if  he  had  located  his  store  elsewhere  (no  other</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>grocery  store  in  town  was  flooded).  Not  having  flood</p>
<p class="calibre1">insurance  was  a  fact.  So  was  the  reality  that  he  couldn't  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">into his store for days. But Greg focused on problems he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">solve, such as how to raise the money to make repairs and buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">new inventory, how to clean the refuse out of his building, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to reopen for business as quickly as possible. He put his</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention  where  it  would  do  him  some  good,  remained  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive as possible, and applied positive action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IT'S A STATE OF MIND</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure is an inside job. So is success. If you want to achieve, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you have to win the war in your thinking first. You can't let the</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure outside you get inside you. You certainly can't control</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  length  of  your  life—but  you  can  control  its  width  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">depth. You cant control the contour of your face—but you can</p>
<p class="calibre1">control its expression. You can't control the weather—but you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can  control  the  atmosphere  of  your  mind.  Why  worry  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">things  you  can't  control  when  you  can  keep  yourself  busy</p>
<p class="calibre1">controlling the things that depend on you? </p>

<p class="calibre1">difficult circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His name is Roger Crawford, and as I write this, he's about</p>
<p class="calibre1">forty years old. He makes his living as a consultant and public</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker.  He  has  written  two  books  and  travels  all  across  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">country  working  with  Fortune  500  companies,  national  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">state associations, and school districts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those aren't bad credentials. But if they don't impress you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  about  this?  Before  becoming  a  consultant,  he  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">varsity  tennis  player  for  Loyola  Marymount  University  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">later  became  a  professional  tennis  player  certified  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  Professional  Tennis  Association.  Still  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed?  Would  you  change  your  opinion  if  I  told  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roger has no hands and only one foot? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NO HANDICAP</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>Roger  Crawford  was  born  with  a  condition  called</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">ectrodactylism. </i> When he emerged from his mothers womb, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctors saw that he had a thumblike projection extending out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his right forearm, and a thumb and finger growing out of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">left  forearm.  He  had  no  palms.  His  legs  and  arms  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">shortened.  And  his  left  leg  possessed  a  shrunken  foot  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  three  toes.  (The  foot  was  amputated  when  he  was  five.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Various  medical  professionals  told  Rogers  parents  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  never  be  able  to  walk,  probably  would  not  be  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take care of himself, and would never lead a normal life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  recovering  from  the  shock,  Roger's  parents  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined  to  give  him  the  best  chance  possible  for  living  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal life. They raised him to feel loved, to be strong, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop  independence.  "You're  only  as  handicapped  as  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to be," his father used to tell him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  he  was  old  enough,  they  sent  him  to  regular  public</p>
<p class="calibre1">schools. They involved him in sports. They encouraged him to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do everything his heart desired. And they taught him to think</p>
<p class="calibre1">positively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Something  my  parents  never  did  was  to  allow  me  to  feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry for myself, or to take advantage of people because of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">handicap," observes Roger. <a href="index_split_003.html#p267">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IF HE CAN DO IT . . . </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Roger appreciated the encouragement and training he received</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  his  parents,  but  I  don't  think  he  really  understood  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">significance  or  the  extent  of  his  achievements  until  he  was  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">college  and  he  interacted  with  someone  who  wanted  to  meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.  He  had  received  a  phone  call  from  a  man  who  had  read</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>about  his  tennis  victories,  and  Roger  agreed  to  meet  him  at  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby restaurant. When Roger stood up to shake hands with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the man, he discovered that the other guy had hands that were</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost identical to his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roger  became  excited  because  he  thought  he  had  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone similar to him but older who could act as his mentor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But after talking with the stranger for a few minutes, he realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was wrong. Roger explains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, what I found was someone with a bitter, pessimistic attitude who</p>
<p class="calibre1">blamed all of life's disappointments and failures on his anatomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  soon  recognized  that  our  lives  and  attitudes  couldn't  have  been  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">different  .  .  .  He  had  never  held  a  job  for  long,  and  he  was  sure  this  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of "discrimination"—certainly not because (as he admitted) he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">constantly  late,  frequently  absent,  and  failed  to  take  any  responsibility  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  work.  His  attitude  was,  "The  world  owes  me,"  and  his  problem  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  world  disagreed.  He  was  even  angry  with  me  because  I  didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">share his despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  kept  in  touch  for  several  years,  miracle  were  suddenly  to  give  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">until  it  dawned  on  me  that  even  if  some  a  perfect  body,  his  unhappiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  lack  of  success  wouldn't  change.  He  would  still  be  at  the  same  place</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his life. <a href="index_split_003.html#p267">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">That man had allowed failure to seize him from the inside, while</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">W</b>hen I get a bit of time off, I like to play golf. I'm not a great</p>
<p class="calibre1">golfer; I'd say I'm average. But I'm a lot better than I once was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I first started playing golf in 1969, I was terrible. I used a</p>
<p class="calibre1">baseball grip, and I tried to muscle the ball down the fairway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which caused my ball to have a big hook, often putting me in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the woods and rough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was twenty-two years old when I started playing. Maybe I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  had  an  easier  time  if  I'd  started  when  I  was  five</p>
<p class="calibre1">years old, as many of today's players did. Who knows? But no</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter what, I'm glad I started golfing, and I can tell you who</p>
<p class="calibre1">sparked my interest in the sport: Arnold Palmer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEFORE TIGER WOODS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Arnold  Palmer  is  one  of  the  great  sportsmen  of  the  twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century,  and  he  really  put  professional  golf  on  the  map.  Rick</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reilly  in  <i class="calibre4">Sports  Illustrated </i> wrote,  "Basically,  he  took  a  game</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  was  a  little  too  prissy,  a  little  too  clubby,  a  little  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">saturated  with  Ivy  League  men  trying  not  to  soil  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">cardigans,  and  breathed  sweet  life  into  it."  Or  as  Vin  Scully</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>says, "In a sport that was high society, he made it  <i class="calibre4">High Noon." </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That's  why  someone  such  as  tour  pro  Rocco  Mediate  told</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer during the hoopla at Palmer's last U.S. Open, "You made</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  this  possible."  Of  Palmer,  Tiger  Woods  simply  stated,  "He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was what I wanted to be like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people of my generation (I was born in 1947) became</p>
<p class="calibre1">golfers because of Arnold Palmer, just as the popularity of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">game  today  has  increased  because  of  Tiger  Woods.  Palmer</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  consummate  golf  professional.  Like  Woods,  he  started</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing as a small boy. And as he grew up, he performed just</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  every  job  he  could  on  a  golf  course.  (His  father  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">golf pro and course superintendent.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer  has  been  active  in  professional  golf  for  more  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">forty years and has won ninety-two championships, sixty-one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them on the U.S. PGA Tour. From 1960 to 1963, he was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest  golfer  in  the  world,  winning  twenty-nine  PGA</p>
<p class="calibre1">victories.  That  ability  got  him  named  <i class="calibre4">Sports  Illustrated's</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sportsman  of  the  Year  in  1960  and  Athlete  of  the  Decade</p>
<p class="calibre1">according  to  an  Associated  Press  poll.  One  writer  said  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer that he combined "the boldness of a Brink's bandit with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fearless confidence of a man on a flying trapeze. He doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">play  a  golf  course,  he  assaults  it." <a href="index_split_003.html#p268">1  </a>And  golf  legend  Bobby</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jones  once  said,  "If  I  ever  had  an  eight-foot  putt,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything I owned depended on it, I'd want Arnold Palmer to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take it for me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer's  down-to-earth  attitude,  sparkling  personality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rugged  good  looks,  and  incredible  playing  ability  caused  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to draw huge crowds of spectators who would follow him from</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole to hole, just as Tiger Woods's fans do today. Back then</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were dubbed "Arnies Army," and it seemed they'd follow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>him anywhere to get a chance to see the man they called "the</p>
<p class="calibre1">King" perform on the course. It was a first for golf, and it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure fun to watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">EVEN THE BEST STUMBLE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  golfer  can  have  a  really  bad  hole—even  a  Hall  of  Famer</p>
<p class="calibre1">like Arnold  Palmer.  The  key  to  playing  through  it  is  to  forget</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  your  bad  shots.  That  can  be  a  difficult  thing  to  do—</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially  when  someone  erects  a  bronze  monument  to  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad hole. That's what happened to Arnold Palmer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  occurred  at  the  1961  Los  Angeles  Open  at  the  peak  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer's  career.  On  the  par-5  ninth  hole,  his  last  of  the  day, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer hit a good drive and wanted to try to put the ball on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">green with his second shot. He would be in position to attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">a birdie, getting one stroke closer to the leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  his  3-wood,  Palmer  hit  what  he  believed  was  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">shot. But as the ball sailed, it faded to the right, hit a pole, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounced out of bounds onto the driving range. Palmer dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">a ball, took a penalty stroke, and tried again. This time, his ball</p>
<p class="calibre1">hooked to the left and flew off the course into a road. Again he</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped  a  ball  and  took  a  penalty  stroke.  He  repeated  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">process, hitting the ball out of bounds several times. Finally he</p>
<p class="calibre1">put  the  ball  on  the  green.  By  then,  he  had  accumulated  <i class="calibre4">ten</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">strokes. It took him two more strokes with his putter to hole the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball. He finished with a twelve. And because of that, he went</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a few strokes behind the leaders to scoring so poorly that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was out of the tournament. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a><b class="calibre3">A MONUMENT TO FAILURE? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,  nearly  forty  years  later,  if  you  go  to  the  ninth  hole  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Rancho  Park  Golf  Course  in  Los Angeles,  you  will  find  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bronze plaque that states: "On Friday, Jan. 6, 1961, the first day</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the 35th Los Angeles Open, Arnold Palmer, voted Golfer of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Year and Pro Athlete of the Year, took a 12 on this hole." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the late 1990s I had the opportunity to meet Arnold Palmer</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing golf. It was down at the Bay Hill Club in Orlando. I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing  with  my  brother,  Larry,  and  there  in  the  foursome</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind us was "the King" himself. As we were winding down</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  day,  I  teed  off  from  the  second-to-last  hole,  and  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hooked  the  ball  really  badly.  It  fired  over  into  the  adjacent</p>
<p class="calibre1">fairway  and  right  at  another  golfer.  To  my  horror  as  I  yelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">"fore," I realized the person about to be beaned was none other</p>
<p class="calibre1">than Palmer. Fortunately he ducked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About six months later, I received this letter in the mail:</p>

<p class="calibre1">to  join  our  amateur  seniors  tour.  It  would  be  our  privilege  to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>have you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John, on a personal note—When you almost decapitated me</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the 17th hole last November, I made a mental note—"That</p>
<p class="calibre1">swing  surely  is  from  a  man  about  to  qualify  for  the  senior</p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit."  I  had  no  idea  until  I  saw  the  member  birthday  roster</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I was so right. This unique swing now qualifies you, along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  your  50th  birthday,  to  be  an  elite  member  of  our  seniors</p>
<p class="calibre1">club. At our lodge, just ask for the senior discount. I am sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  won't  need  I.D.  The  staff  prides  itself  on  recognizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">senior ability by hair color, facial lines, and other attributes. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">all else fails, just show them your swing. That'll do it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happy 50th birthday, John Maxwell! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Arnold Palmer</p>
<p class="calibre1">Good golfers don't dwell on bad performances—not if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to remain good golfers. And that has always been true of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arnold Palmer. Once when asked about his performance at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Open on hole nine, he commented, "That doggone plaque will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  there  long  after  I'm  gone.  But  you  have  to  put  things  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that behind you. That's one of the wonderful things about golf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your  next  shot  can  be  as  good  or  bad  as  your  last  one—but</p>
<p class="calibre1">you"ll always get another chance." <a href="index_split_003.html#p268">2</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">achiever:  the  ability  to  put  past  events  behind  him  and  move</p>
<p class="calibre1">on. That quality positions a person to tackle current challenges</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>with  enthusiasm  and  a  minimum  of  burdensome  personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">baggage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  contrast,  someone  who  is  unable  to  get  over  previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurts and failures is held hostage by the past. The baggage he</p>
<p class="calibre1">carries around makes it very difficult for him to move forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, in more than thirty years of working with people, I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet to meet a successful person who continually dwelled on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">past difficulties. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">successful person who continually dwelled on his past difficulties. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  years  ago,  I  heard  my  friend  Chuck  Swindoll  tell  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story  of  Chippie  the  parakeet.  He  said  the  bird's  problems</p>
<p class="calibre1">began  when  the  woman  who  owned  him  decided  to  clean  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the seeds and loose feathers from the bottom of his cage using</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  vacuum.  When  the  phone  rang,  the  owner  turned  to  pick  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, and— you guessed it—with a thud and a whoosh, Chippie</p>
<p class="calibre1">was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The owner quickly turned off the vacuum and unzipped the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag. There was Chippie. He was stunned but breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  that  he  was  covered  with  black  dust,  his  owner</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed Chippie to the bathtub, where she turned on the faucet</p>
<p class="calibre1">full blast and held the bird under the icy water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that point she realized that she'd done even more damage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and she quickly cranked up her blow dryer and gave the wet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shivering  little  parakeet  a  blast.  Chuck  finished  the  story  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, "Chippie doesn't sing much anymore . . ." </p>
<p class="calibre1">People who are unable to overcome the past are a little like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chippie. They allow their negative experiences to color the way</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>they live their lives today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  may  sound  as  if  I'm  making  light  of  what  may  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened to you in the past. I'm not. I know that people suffer</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine  tragedies  in  this  imperfect  world.  They  lose  children, </p>
<p class="calibre1">spouses,  parents,  and  friends—sometimes  under  horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances.  (My  dad  lost  his  mother  before  he  was  eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  old.)  People  contract  cancer,  multiple  sclerosis,  AIDS, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  debilitating  diseases.  They  suffer  unspeakable</p>
<p class="calibre1">abuses at the hands of others. All of these things are true. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">tragedies  don't  have  to  stop  a  person  from  possessing  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive outlook, being productive, and living life to the fullest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One man is born with severe disabilities and decides the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">owes him, while another (such as Roger Crawford) goes on to</p>
<p class="calibre1">become a tennis pro. One person who contracts AIDS bitterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives  up  on  life,  while  another  (such  as  basketball's  Magic</p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson)  builds  his  business  and  enjoys  his  family  life.  One</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman  experiences  rape  and  withdraws  into  herself,  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">another (such as Kelly McGillis) overcomes the experience and</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes  a  successful  actress  in  Hollywood.  No  matter  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark  a  person's  past  is,  it  need  not  color  his  present</p>
<p class="calibre1">permanently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SIGNS OF PAST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BREAKDOWN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In my experience, the problems of people's pasts impact them in</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  two  ways:  They  experience  either  a  breakdown  or  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakthrough. The following five characteristics are signs that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>people haven't gotten over past difficulties:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The problems of people's pasts impact them in one of two ways: They experience</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">either a breakdown or a breakthrough. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. Comparison</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  hear  people  continually  talk  about  how  much  harder</p>
<p class="calibre1">they've had it than anyone else, chances are, they are allowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  to  be  held  hostage  by  their  past.  Their  motto  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar to something Quentin Crisp once said: "Never keep up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the Joneses. Drag them down to your level. It's cheaper." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Rationalization</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  characteristic  of  people  trapped  by  their  pasts  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">rationalization: believing that there are good reasons not to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">over past difficulties. Rationalization creates a fog that hinders</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  from  finding  solutions  to  their  problems.  Excuses,  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter how strong, never lead to achievement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Isolation</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I've mentioned, some people withdraw due to their past</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurts.  For  many,  it's  like  a  natural  reflex  that  kicks  in  for  self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection. When naturally outgoing people isolate themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of the past, they become especially miserable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Author  C  .  S  .  Lewis  asserted,  "We  are  born  helpless. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  as  we  are  fully  conscious  we  discover  loneliness.  We</p>
<p class="calibre1">need  others  physically,  emotionally,  intellectually;  we  need</p>
<p class="calibre1">them if we are to know anything, even ourselves." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Regret</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A significant hindrance to living life in the present is regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  saps  people's  energy  and  leaves  little  enabling  them  to  do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>anything positive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  friend  Dwight  Bain  E-mailed  me  something  called  "The</p>
<p class="calibre1">City of Regret" that tells the whole story:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  not  really  planned  to  take  a  trip  this  year,  yet  I  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself packing anyway. And off I went, dreading it. I was on</p>
<p class="calibre1">another guilt trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I booked my reservation on  <i class="calibre4">Wish  I  Had </i> airlines. I didn't check</p>
<p class="calibre1">my bags—everyone carries their baggage on this airline—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  to  drag  it  for  what  seemed  like  miles  in  the  Regret  City</p>
<p class="calibre1">airport. And  I  could  see  that  people  from  all  over  the  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  there  with  me,  limping  along  under  the  weight  of  bags</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had packed themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I caught a cab to Last Resort Hotel, the driver taking the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">trip backward, looking over his shoulder. And there I found the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ballroom where my event would be held: the Annual Pity Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I checked in, I saw that all my old colleagues were on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guest list:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Done  family—Would  a,  Coulda,  and  Shoulda  Both  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Opportunities—Missed  and  Lost  All  the  Yesterdays—there  were  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  to  count,  but  all  would  have  sad  stories  to  share  Shattered  Dreams</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Broken  Promises  would  be  there,  too,  along  with  their  friends  Don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blame Me and Couldn't Help It. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  of  course,  hours  and  hours  of  entertainment  would  be  provided  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">that renowned storyteller  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">It's Their Fault. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I prepared to settle in for a really long night, I realized that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one person had the power to send all those people home and</p>
<p class="calibre1">break up the party: me. All I had to do was return to the present</p>
<p class="calibre1">and welcome the new day! </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have found yourself getting on a flight to the City of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Regret, recognize that it's a trip you book yourself, and you can</p>
<p class="calibre1">cancel  it  at  any  time—without  penalty  or  fee.  But  you're  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only one who can. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <i class="calibre4">Bitterness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People who don't get beyond the problems or the pain of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past eventually become bitter. It is the inevitable consequence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of not processing old injuries and tragedies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wes Roberts, president of Life Enrichment, advises, "People</p>
<p class="calibre1">do  not  have  to  remain  victims  of  their  pasts."  But  when  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">do,  they  become  prisoners  of  their  own  emotions.  "Often  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">adults, those prisons are addictions—workaholism, alcoholism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual  addictions,  eating  addictions.  We  place  ourselves  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">prison." In other words, we allow the past to hold us hostage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter what you've experienced, remember this: There are</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  who've  had  it  better  than  you  and  done  worse. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">there are people who've had it worse than you and done better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The circumstances really have nothing to do with getting over</p>
<p class="calibre1">your personal history. Past hurts can make you bitter or better</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the choice is yours. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BREAKTHROUGH: THE ALTERNATIVE TO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BREAKDOWN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Every major difficulty you face in life is a fork in the road. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">choose which track you will head down, toward breakdown or</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakthrough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dick Biggs, a consultant who helps Fortune 500 companies</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve profits and increase productivity, writes that all of us</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>have  unfair  experiences;  as  a  result,  some  people  merely  exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">and adopt a "cease and desist" mentality. He continues, </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">track you will head down, toward breakdown or breakthrough. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  best  teachers  of  persistence  is  your  life's  critical</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning  points.  Expect  to  experience  3-9  turning  points  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">"significant  changes"  in  your  life.  These  transitions  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy  experiences  .  .  .  or  unhappy  times  such  as  job  losses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">divorce,  financial  setbacks,  health  problems  and  the  death  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved ones. Turning points can provide perspective, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ability to view major changes within the larger framework of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  lifetime  and  let  the  healing  power  of  time  prevail.  By</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning  from  your  turning  points,  you  can  grow  at  a  deeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">level within your career and life. <a href="index_split_003.html#p268">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you've been badly hurt, then start by acknowledging the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pain  and  grieving  any  loss  you  may  have  experienced.  Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgive  the  people  involved—including  yourself,  if  needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doing  that  will  help  you  move  on.  (If  you  cannot  accomplish</p>
<p class="calibre1">that on your own, enlist the help of a professional.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I understand that it may be very difficult to go through this</p>
<p class="calibre1">process, but you can do it. Just think,  <i class="calibre4">today </i> may be your day</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  turn  the  hurts  of  your  past  into  a  breakthrough  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future. Don't allow anything from your personal history to keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding you hostage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A DREAM BECKONS TO THE EAST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>One  person  who  always  traveled  light  (without  too  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal  baggage)  was  Sister  Frances  Cabrini.  On  the  March</p>
<p class="calibre1">day in 1889 when the thirty-eight-year-old nun got off the boat</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Ellis  Island,  she  was  thinking  about  the  task  ahead  of  her:</p>
<p class="calibre1">helping  establish  an  orphanage,  school,  and  convent  in  New</p>
<p class="calibre1">York  City.  She  wasn't  preoccupied  with  any  of  the  problems</p>
<p class="calibre1">from her past, though she had experienced plenty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francesca  Lodi-Cabrini  was  born  two  months  premature  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lombardy town of Sant'Angelo, Italy, where she remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sickliest child in her village as she grew up. At age six, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided  that  she  wanted  to  become  a  missionary  to  China. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, people mocked her dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A missionary order would never accept a girl who is ill most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the time," her sister Rosa scoffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  age  twelve,  she  took  a  vow  of  chastity,  and  when  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached the required minimum age of eighteen, she applied to</p>
<p class="calibre1">join the Daughters of the Sacred Heart Convent. But she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed rejected because she was too sickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rejection was not going to make Cabrini give up her dream</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ministering in Asia. She began doing what she could in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">own  village  to  build  her  strength  and  prove  her  worth.  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">taught neighborhood children. She cared for an older villager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  when  a  smallpox  epidemic  hit,  she  nursed  family  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends  through  it  until  she  became  sick. After  she  recovered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she reapplied to the convent. She was turned down again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A STEP FORWARD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>After six years, Cabrini finally gained acceptance into the order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  thought  that  milestone  would  put  her  one  step  closer  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving  her  dream  of  serving  in  China.  But  she  was  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience  many  additional  setbacks.  Both  her  parents  died</p>
<p class="calibre1">within a year. Then she was assigned to teach at a local school</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather  than  one  overseas.  When  she  applied  to  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations  devoted  to  working  in  Asia,  she  was  rejected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon  she  was  assigned  to  oversee  a  small  orphanage  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Codogno, a town not more than fifty miles from her home. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent  six  frustrating  years  there  before  the  orphanage  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she still dreamed of traveling to Asia, a superior told</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  that  if  she  wanted  to  be  part  of  a  missionary  order,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  start  one  herself.  So  that's  what  she  did.  With  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance  of  a  half-dozen  girls  from  the  orphanage,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">founded  the  Missionary  Sisters  of  the  Sacred  Heart  in  1880. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  next  eight  years,  she  built  the  order,  establishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">foundations in Milan, Rome, and other Italian cities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She tried to earn a place in Asia, but Pope Leo XIII put an</p>
<p class="calibre1">end  to  Cabrini's  dream  of  ministering  in  China.  He  told  her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not to the east, but to the west. You will find a vast field of</p>
<p class="calibre1">labor in the United States." She was to help run an orphanage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">school, and convent in New York City. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A TRIP WEST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That is how Sister Frances Cabrini came to be at Ellis Island in</p>
<p class="calibre1">March 1889. Her lifelong dream of serving in Asia lay in ruins</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind her in Italy, the only home she'd ever known. But she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>didn't  look  back.  She  was  not  someone  to  allow  the  past  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold her hostage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  next  twenty-eight  years,  she  dedicated  herself  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  task  of  ministering  to  people  in  the  Americas.  And  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcame  plenty  of  obstacles  to  do  it.  When  she  arrived  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York,  she  was  told  that  the  plans  for  the  orphanage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">school,  and  convent  had  fallen  through,  and  that  she  should</p>
<p class="calibre1">return  to  Italy.  Instead,  she  solved  the  problems  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">having and established the facilities as planned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  didn't  matter  what  difficulties  she  faced,  she  continually</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcame them. By the time she died in 1917 at age sixty-seven, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she  had  founded  more  than  seventy  hospitals,  schools,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">orphanages  in  the  United  States,  Spain,  France,  England,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">South America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cabrini's impact was incredible. She was the Mother Teresa</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her day—possessing similar compassion, grit, tenacity, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership. But she never would have made a difference if she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had allowed her past to hold her hostage. Instead of lamenting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loss of her dream and the hurts of her youth, she moved on</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  did  what  she  could  where  God  put  her.  My  hope  is  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can do the same. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AUDUBON'S BEGINNINGS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The son of a French sea captain, Audubon was born in Haiti in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1785, but spent his formative years in France. He was educated</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a gentleman, but was at best an indifferent student. Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his lack of discipline, he was sent to military school at age</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourteen, but he didn't flourish in that environment either. His</p>
<p class="calibre1">real passion was hunting and drawing birds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At age eighteen, Audubon was sent to America. His father</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt that opportunity lay in the New World. Audubon landed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pennsylvania and moved into a house his father owned there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  his  new  surroundings  he  honed  his  skills  as  a  woodsman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He continued hunting and drawing wildlife, and it wasn't long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before he met and developed a relationship with a neighboring</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>family named the Bakewells. They had a significant impact on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his life. First, he fell in love with one of the family's daughters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucy.  Second,  in  1807,  he  started  working  in  the  counting</p>
<p class="calibre1">house  of  Benjamin  Bakewell's  import  company.  That  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">start of what would become an abysmal career in business. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A CAREER IN TRADE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Audubon's  first  venture,  which  dealt  in  indigo  dye,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicative  of  his  performance:  It  lost  him  a  small  fortune.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked at the import business for a while, but after meeting no</p>
<p class="calibre1">success,  Audubon  decided  to  try  his  hand  at  retail  trade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  his  father's  connections,  he  hooked  up  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ferdinand  Rozier,  a  young  French  businessman,  and  the  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">men headed west to Louisville, Kentucky, on the banks of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ohio River. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  set  up  for  business,  but  met  with  minimal  success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rozier possessed tenacity for trade while Audubon displayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  qualities  that  marked  his  entire  life:  hunting  skill, </p>
<p class="calibre1">undisciplined  curiosity,  unfailing  energy,  and  artistic  power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Rozier  manned  the  counter  in  the  shop,  Audubon</p>
<p class="calibre1">roamed the countryside hunting and bringing back birds to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn or served at the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  that  time,  Audubon's  favorite  contributions  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  were  his  trips  to  Philadelphia  and  New  York  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase goods for the store because he had a chance to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  countryside.  On  one  of  those  trips,  he  returned  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pennsylvania and married Lucy Bakewell and took her back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Louisville with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>The partners worked together for a while, but it wasn't long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  the  business  was  in  trouble  financially.  To  raise  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  money,  Audubon  sold  Lucy's  share  of  her  family's</p>
<p class="calibre1">estate and paid off their creditors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAKING CHANGES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  partners  then  decided  that  a  new  location  would  help</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,  and  they  went  downstream  to  Henderson,  Kentucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They lasted six months there and then made another change in</p>
<p class="calibre1">location, this time to the banks of the Mississippi River. After</p>
<p class="calibre1">much difficulty, they set up shop in  <i class="calibre4">Ste. </i> Genevieve, Missouri, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">settlement of French Canadians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  before,  Audubon  wasn't  content  with  the  business  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade  and  spent  most  of  his  time  hunting  birds,  then  drawing</p>
<p class="calibre1">and painting them. After a short time, he sold his share in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shop,  and  the  two  partners  went  their  separate  ways.  Rozier</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept  the  business  and  became  highly  successful.  Audubon</p>
<p class="calibre1">went in search of another opportunity. Audubon's biographer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Chancellor, asserted, "Audubon believed that he should</p>
<p class="calibre1">persevere  in  commerce  and  that  shooting,  mounting  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing birds should remain an absorbing hobby." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MORE FAILURES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  next  ten  years,  Audubon  embarked  on  a  series  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsuccessful  ventures.  In  1811,  he  decided  to  return  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>import  business.  He  and  his  brother-in-law,  Thomas</p>
<p class="calibre1">Woodhouse Bakewell, established a commission house in New</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orleans importing goods from England. Unfortunately they did</p>
<p class="calibre1">that on the eve of the War of 1812. Of course, their business</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Audubon  and  his  brother-in-law  went  back  to  work  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">trading  goods—again  in  Henderson,  Kentucky.  They  saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">some success there, but then they made another poor business</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision. They chose to open a steam sawmill and gristmill in</p>
<p class="calibre1">an area that could not support such a large operation. By 1819, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they had gone bankrupt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  through  the  years,  two  things  remained  constant  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Audubon's life: hunting and art. Now he had to rely on both to</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive. His gun put food on the table for his small family (he</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Lucy had two young boys by then), and he drew portraits</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  commission  to  bring  in  money.  By  default  rather  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">design, his hobby became his means of support. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FINALLY THE RIGHT KIND OF CHANGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1820,  Audubon  had  what  he  called  his  "Great  Idea."  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided  to  create  a  comprehensive  and  complete  printed</p>
<p class="calibre1">collection  of  all American  birds  based  on  his  paintings.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be life-size and shown in their natural surroundings. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">the next few years, he traveled and added more painted birds to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  portfolio  while  Lucy  worked  as  a  tutor  and  governess  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Louisiana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  1826,  he  had  enough  material.  Audubon  sailed  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Liverpool,  England,  and  immediately  met  with  great  success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wrote  back  to  his  wife,  Lucy,  "I  am  well  received</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>everywhere, my works praised and admired, and my poor heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  at  the  last  relieved  from  the  great  anxiety  that  has  for  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many years agitated it, for I now know that I have not worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">in vain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Audubon  became  associated  with  engraver  Robert  Havell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  together  they  began  printing  the  remarkable  <i class="calibre4">Birds  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">America, </i> a series of one hundred color plates in a large 29-by-</p>
<p class="calibre1">39-inch  format.  Audubon  wrote  of  the  effort,  "Who  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe that a lonely individual, who landed in England without</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  friend  in  the  whole  country,  and  with  only  sufficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">pecuniary  means  to  travel  through  it  as  a  visitor,  could  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplished such a task as this publication?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  publication  of  his  book  finally  gave  him  financial</p>
<p class="calibre1">security—and  it  made  him  famous  all  over  Europe  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States.  Nothing  else  like  it  had  ever  been  created,  nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">has any other book of prints since been so revered. In all, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">printed  about  two  hundred  copies  of  that  first  edition.  Today</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  considered  a  masterpiece.  An  original  <i class="calibre4">Birds  of  America, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">which  sold  for  $1,000  in  the  1820s,  is  now  worth  about  $5</p>
<p class="calibre1">million! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE PROBLEM WAS HIM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">John James Audubon was unsuccessful for most of his life. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">took  him  until  he  was  thirty-five  years  old  to  figure  out  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  problem  was:  himself.  He  was  a  terrible  businessman,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  didn't  belong  in  trade.  It  didn't  matter  how  many  times  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed  locations,  partners,  or  business  types.  Not  until  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood  and  changed  himself  did  he  have  a  chance  at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>success.  For  years  this  saying  could  have  applied  to  him:  If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  could  kick  the  person  responsible  for  most  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubles, you wouldn't be able to sit down for weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evangelist D. L. Moody was once asked which people gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">him the most trouble. His response was, "I've had more trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Dwight  L.  Moody  than  any  other  man  alive."  Television</p>
<p class="calibre1">host  Jack  Paar  echoed  that  same  thought:  "Looking  back,  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life  seems  like  one  long  obstacle  race,  with  me  as  its  chief</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstacle." If you are continually experiencing trouble or facing</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstacles, then you should check to make sure that  <i class="calibre4">you </i> are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHY WON'T PEOPLE CHANGE? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">People don't like to admit that they need to change. And if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are willing to alter things about themselves, they usually focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  cosmetic  changes.  Perhaps  that's  why  Emerson  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"People are always getting ready to live but never living." Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone who wants to live in a better world needs to be willing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to change himself. Psychiatrist Rudolf Dreikurs, director of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago, observed, "We can change</p>
<p class="calibre1">our whole life and the attitude of people around us simply by</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing ourselves." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">We can change our whole life and the attitude of people around us simply by</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">changing ourselves. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—RUDOLF DREIKURS</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Why are people so hesitant to change? I believe that some, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like Audubon, believe they are supposed to pursue a particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">course of action for some reason—even though it doesn't suit</p>
<p class="calibre1">their gifts and talents. And when they are not working in areas</p>
<p class="calibre1">of strength, they do poorly. Others are not self-aware and don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  know  what  their  strengths  are. As  Ben  Franklin  noted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know one's self." Still others hinder themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  read  an  article  about  a  nineteenth-century  French  chess</p>
<p class="calibre1">champion  named  Alexandre  Deschapelles.  He  was  a  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">player who quickly became a champion in his region. But when</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  got  tough,  he  decided  that  he  would  play  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">opponent  only  if  the  person  would  remove  one  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deschapelles's pawns and then make the first move. That way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he would not look bad no matter what happened. If he lost, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  say  that  he  had  been  at  a  disadvantage.  If  he  won,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  seem  that  much  more  talented.  Today,  psychologists</p>
<p class="calibre1">call that mind-set the Deschapelles Coup. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHANGING YOUR MIND</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist  Sheldon  Kopp  says,  "All  of  the  significant</p>
<p class="calibre1">battles are waged within the self." That's true. People wage the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest battles against their own flaws and failures. For years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">John  James Audubon  must  have  regarded  his  desire  to  grab</p>
<p class="calibre1">his gun and sketch pad and disappear into the woods as a fatal</p>
<p class="calibre1">flaw because he thought he should be running a business. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he realized that his gun and notepad were the tools of his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>business, everything became clearer in his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">All of the significant battles are waged within the self. </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Marshall,  a  self-described  late  bloomer,  has  experienced  more</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Most  people  try  to  beat  down  their  flaws  or  deny  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether," notes Marshall. "I've always found it best to say, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Don't  use  your  flaws  as  an  excuse  to  quit.  Move  forward  or</p>

<p class="calibre1">declared, "It is nothing to die. It is an awful thing never to have</p>

<p class="calibre1">To  have  an  opportunity  to  reach  your  potential,  you  must</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>know who you are and face your flaws. Allow me to help you</p>
<p class="calibre1">do that. Go through the following process:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">1. See Yourself Clearly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bishop  Fulton  Sheen  offered  this  insight,  "Most  of  us  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not like to look inside ourselves for the same reason we don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">like to open a letter that has bad news." Many people see all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bad and deny the good, or they see all the good and deny</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bad. To reach your potential, you must see both. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">2. Admit Your Flaws Honestly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Chapter  5  I  stated  that  you  must  take  responsibility  for</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">your </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">actions </i> to  fail  forward.  But  you  must  also  take</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility for who  <i class="calibre4">you are as a person. </i> That means owning</p>
<p class="calibre1">up  to  what  you  cannot  do  (based  on  skill),  should  not  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">(based  on  talent),  and  ought  not  do  (based  on  character). </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's not always easy to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">3. Discover Your Strengths Joyfully</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Working on your strengths is the next step in the process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one ever achieved his dreams working outside his areas of</p>
<p class="calibre1">gifting. To excel, do what you do well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">4. Build on Those Strengths Passionately</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Like Audubon, you will improve only if you enthusiastically</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop your God-given abilities. You can reach your potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow if you dedicate yourself to growth today. Remember, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to change your world, you must first change yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHO IS THIS PERSON? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  greatest  stories  of  change  that  I  know  personally</p>
<p class="calibre1">involves  someone  very  close  to  me  in  my  organization,  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">INJOY  Group.  As  I  worked  on  this  book  and  was  thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  whose  story  I  should  tell  in  this  chapter,  my  assistant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda Eggers, suggested that maybe her story would help you</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand  the  impact  that  changing  yourself  can  make  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">your life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you've  ever  heard  me  speak  in  person,  then  you've</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably heard me talk about Linda. I believe that Linda is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">finest executive assistant in the country. But I haven't always</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt  that  way  about  her.  A  few  years  ago  we  experienced  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rocky  time  in  our  history,  and  the  fact  that  we  work  together</p>
<p class="calibre1">now is a strong testament to her willingness and ability to take</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  hard  look  at  herself,  make  some  changes  in  her  life,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">become the kind of person she desired to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">To excel, do what you do well. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda  began  working  for  me  in  the  mid-1980s  when  I  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading Skyline Church in San Diego as its senior pastor. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had a job in the financial office with Steve Babby, our CFO. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was also about that time that I formed The INJOY Group with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>the  help  of  my  good  friend  Dick  Peterson.  Back  then  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">functioned  on  a  shoestring,  and  our  "staff"  consisted  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">handful  of  volunteers,  including  Linda  and  her  husband, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patrick. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HELPING BUILD THE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TEAM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After Linda had been working new conference I was teaching</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  southern  California.  During  the  course  of  that  conference, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda  realized  that  she  felt  called  to  work  with  me  at  INJOY, </p>
<p class="calibre1">helping  me  to  equip  pastors  to  become  better  leaders.  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached  me  after  the  conference  and  shared  her  thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">with me. Later when INJOY was big enough, we brought her on</p>
<p class="calibre1">staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda immediately became an impact player for us under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership of Dick Peterson, now the COO of The INJOY Group</p>
<p class="calibre1">and president of INJOY Conferences and Resources. Linda did</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever was asked of her, and that was just about everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  managed  the  office,  hired  staff,  performed  accounting</p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks,  and  even  assisted  with  product  development.  As  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew,  she  took  on  greater  and  greater  responsibility.  By  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early 1990s, she was Dick's right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MAKING THESE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a><b class="calibre3">MISTAKES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  suddenly  one  day,  Linda  quit.  She  gave  two  weeks' </p>
<p class="calibre1">notice, and she was gone. She didn't give any explanation; she</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply bailed on us. Dick and I were shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few weeks later I found out that Linda had gone to work</p>
<p class="calibre1">for an accountant friend of mine as his secretary. I was amazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">because  she  had  always  been  passionate  about  the  kind  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">work  we  did.  I  couldn't  see  her  being  happy  merely  typing</p>
<p class="calibre1">letters and doing simple data entry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  something  even  more  surprising  happened.  I  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Linda was becoming very negative about me and INJOY. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  wasn't  being  malicious,  but  her  comments  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">inappropriate. And  that  saddened  me  because  I  always  liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  life  went  on.  Dick  hired  someone  to  replace</p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda,  and  the  company  continued  its  growth.  About  eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">months later, I got a phone call telling me Linda wanted to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.  On  the  day  that  she  came  to  my  office,  she  was  shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as she talked, she started to cry. She apologized for all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative  things  she  had  been  saying.  Then  she  told  me  why</p>
<p class="calibre1">she quit and what led to her feelings of bitterness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  was  working  so  hard  and  so  many  hours,"  Linda  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that  it  was  killing  me.  I  thought  nobody  cared.  I  realize  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I should have gone to Dick or come to you and told you</p>
<p class="calibre1">how I was feeling. But I was in performance mode, and I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">too proud to cry 'uncle.' Then I started a pity-me party. John, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am very sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda went on to say that it took her only a month at her new</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>job  to  realize  she  had  made  a  big  mistake;  she  should  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">stayed at INJOY. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you going to do now?" I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. I'm not going to stay where I am because I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">handled that poorly too. I guess I'm going to look for a job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would  you  ever  think  about  coming  back  to  INJOY?"  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you think you could trust me again?" she replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know . . . , " I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later  that  day,  Dick  told  me  that  Linda  had  met  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">apologized  to  him  too.  She  also  apologized  to  her  current</p>
<p class="calibre1">employer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dick  and  I  talked  about  it,  and  he  offered  to  hire  her  back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it would be in a different capacity. The only thing available</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the time was a position taking incoming calls and answering</p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondence. It must have been difficult for Linda, who had</p>
<p class="calibre1">once  been  Dick's  second  in  command,  but  she  accepted.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1">three years, Linda worked hard and did everything asked of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  excellence  and  a  positive  attitude,  and  over  time,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to assist Dick more and more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HELPING MAKE A</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DIFFERENCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  left  the  pastorate  at  Skyline  in  1995  to  devote  myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">full-time to The INJOY Group, I needed to hire a new assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And one of the people I considered was Linda. I knew she was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>highly  competent;  the  only  issue  I  needed  to  settle  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  I  could  trust  her  unconditionally.  An  executive</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistant who works with me has to be capable of running my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, dealing with sensitive and personal information about me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and my family, and representing me well with everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  didn't  take  me  long  to  settle  the  issue.  I  knew  I  wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">Linda to be my assistant. Since that day, I've never looked back</p>
<p class="calibre1">or doubted her. In fact, if she hadn't courageously suggested I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell her story, it never would have occurred to me to share it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Linda  started  working  with  me  again,  she  told  me</p>
<p class="calibre1">something interesting. "From the early days when I worked at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skyline back in '86," she said, "I always believed that someday</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would be your assistant. And to think that I almost blew it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The turning point for me was the day I looked at myself in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mirror and realized that I needed to make some changes in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life—starting with my attitude. If I hadn't, I never would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">gotten  the  opportunity  to  do  the  work  that  I  believe  God  put</p>
<p class="calibre1">me here to do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, Linda is awesome. I marvel at what she is capable of</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing. And every time I make a positive impact on anyone with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a conference or book, she is a part of it. I wouldn't trade her for</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone else in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As you read this, if you are not happy with your current job, </p>

<p class="calibre1">wonderful  movie  called  <i class="calibre4">Mr.  Holland's  Opus </i> that  beautifully</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrated the whole process. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">IT STARTED AS ATHANK-YOU</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  movie  was  written  by  screenwriter  up  with  the  idea  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">day while stuck in a traffic jam. He heard a news report on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">radio about the cutback in school programs and the number of</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers in the state of California. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suddenly  I  realized  how  important  my  own  teachers  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  in  my  life,"  says  Duncan,  "and  that  the  most  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing we can do as adults is educate our children." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Duncan  remembered  the  one  special  teacher  who  made  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference in his life. "She was reputed to be the meanest and</p>
<p class="calibre1">toughest  teacher  at  my  junior  high,"  he  recalls.  "But  she  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the one who bought me my books and gave me her own son's</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing after he'd grown out of them.  <i class="calibre4">Mr. Holland's Opus </i> is a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>tribute to her and everyone else in her grand profession." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ONE MAN'S JOURNEY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  movie  is  the  story  of  Glenn  Holland  (played  by  Richard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dreyfuss), a young musician who desires to make it to the big</p>
<p class="calibre1">time as a composer. But when money gets tight, and he needs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take care of his family, he reluctantly seeks employment as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacher.  That  job,  which  he  takes  only  on  a  temporary  basis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes  his  life.  Through  the  course  of  the  movie,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovers  that  he  wants  to  share  his  love  for  music  with  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">students, and in the process, he discovers himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pivotal  point  of  the  movie  comes  when  Mr.  Hollands</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaching  position  is  eliminated  because  of  cutbacks,  and  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly  realizes  he  has  reached  middle  age.  In  that  moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  knows  that  he  has  forever  missed  his  chance  to  pull  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">roots, go to New York, and take his symphony with him, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  has  been  writing  in  his  spare  moments  for  the  last  twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">years.  Despondent  and  feeling  rejected,  he  believes  he  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasted his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is depressed and on the verge of bitterness, as he leaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  classroom.  He  ambles  dejectedly  down  the  hall,  preparing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to walk out of the school for the last time. That's when he hears</p>
<p class="calibre1">something in the auditorium. When he checks to see what it is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  discovers  dozens  and  dozens  of  students  whose  lives  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed  during  all  his  years  of  teaching.  That  group  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">includes the governor of the state, whose life took a major turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the better under his mentoring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a><b class="calibre3">AN ORDINARY MAN DOING SOMETHING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">EXTRAORDINARY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The director of the movie, Stephen Herek, was attracted to  <i class="calibre4">Mr. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Hollands  Opus </i> because the screenplay touched him. "It made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me cry," he admitted. "Very rarely do I read something where I</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually end up with tears flowing freely. But that's how I felt at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  end  of  [the  script].  The  story  makes  a  hero  out  of  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyman  who  happens  to  be  a  teacher,  which  I  think  is  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">important thing to do. . . .It's also a story about how one human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being can affect a lot of other people and touch their lives in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very special way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people believe that touching the lives of others can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">done only by some elite group of specially gifted people. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">that's  not  the  case.  Any  ordinary  person—just  like  Glenn</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland in the movie—can make a positive impact on the lives</p>
<p class="calibre1">of others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  unsuccessful  people  tell  themselves  that  as  soon  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  achieve  considerable  success  or  discover  some  unseen</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent, they will turn their attention to making a difference in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives  of  others.  But  I  have  news  for  them.  Many  people  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle  with  chronic  failure  do  so  <i class="calibre4">because </i> they  think  of  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one but themselves. They worry about what other people think</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them. They scramble to make sure no one gets the better of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. They continually focus on protecting their turf. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">think of no one but themselves. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Years ago I read an article about New York Yankees manager</p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy  Martin  that  described  him  as  a  person  who  acted  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.  The  author  said  that  in  his  later  years,  the  former</p>
<p class="calibre1">ballplayer  spent  much  of  his  energy  second-guessing</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed  enemies  and  foiling  imaginary  plots  against  him.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't  know  to  what  extent  that  is  true,  but  I  do  know  this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Martin  was  hired  and  fired  from  his  position  as  Yankees</p>
<p class="calibre1">manager  <i class="calibre4">five </i> times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  dad  loves  to  tell  jokes,  and  the  cornier  they  are,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better he likes them. I recall going to an NFL ball game with him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in San Diego, and as the Chargers huddled up, he leaned over</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  me  and  said,  "John,  did  you  hear  about  the  guy  who  quit</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  to  football  games?  Every  time  the  team  huddled  up,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought they were talking about him!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  continually  focus  all  your  energy  and  attention  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself,  I  have  a  message  for  you:  <i class="calibre4">Get  over  yourself-—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">everyone else has. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  have  a  history  of  repeated  failure  <i class="calibre4">a n d </i> you  dedicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  of  your  time  and  energy  to  looking  out  for  number  one, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  may  need  to  learn  a  new  way  of  thinking—where  others</p>
<p class="calibre1">come  first.  If  you  suspect  that  a  selfish  streak  is  preventing</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  from  achieving  your  goals  and  dreams,  you  may  need  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change and improve your approach to success. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">STOP FOCUSING ON</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">YOURSELF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  you  need  to  think  about  others  rather  than  yourself. A</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>major cause of negative thinking and poor mental health is self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">absorption.  Selfishness  ultimately  hurts  not  only  the  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  a  self-focused  person,  but  also  the  selfish  person</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.  It  inclines  the  person  toward  failure  because  it  keeps</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in a negative mental rut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  is  the  reason  that  Dr.  Karl  Menninger  responded  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way  he  did  when  someone  asked,"What  would  you  advise  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">person to do if he felt a nervous breakdown coming on?" Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  expected  him  to  reply,  "Consult  a  psychiatrist,"  since</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  was  his  profession.  To  their  astonishment,  Menninger</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied, "Lock up your house, go across the railway tracks, find</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone in need, and do something to help that person." <a href="index_split_003.html#p270">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">My friend Kevin Myers points out that "most people are too</p>
<p class="calibre1">insecure  to  give  anything  away."  I  believe  that's  true.  Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  who  focus  all  their  attention  on  themselves  feel  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they're missing something in their lives, so they're trying to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">it back. For example, here are some needs and the common side</p>
<p class="calibre1">effects that occur when they're missing:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Inner Need If Missing,I Feel... </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Belonging</p>
<p class="calibre1">Insecure</p>
<p class="calibre1">Worth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inferior</p>
<p class="calibre1">Competence</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inadequate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Purpose</p>
<p class="calibre1">Insignificant</p>
<p class="calibre1">Developing  a  giving  spirit,  as  Menninger  implied,  helps  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">person  to  overcome  some  feelings  of  deficiency  in  a  positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  healthy  way.  That's  why  Menninger  believed  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">"generous  people  are  rarely  mentally  ill  people." A  person  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">less likely to focus on himself if he is trying to help someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">else. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><b class="calibre3">STOP TAKING YOURSELF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Too SERIOUSLY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In my seminars, I work with a lot of leaders. And I've found that</p>
<p class="calibre1">many of them take themselves much too seriously. Of course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they're not alone. I meet people in every walk of life who have</p>
<p class="calibre1">too  much  doom  and  gloom  in  their  attitudes.  They  need  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighten  up.  No  matter  how  serious  your  work  is,  that's  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason to take  <i class="calibre4">yourself </i> seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few weeks ago, I was in Australia teaching leadership to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">group of several thousand businesspeople. And I was talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">to them about how most of us think that we are more important</p>
<p class="calibre1">than we really are. I told everyone that on the day I die, one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my good pastor friends will give me a wonderful eulogy and tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">funny  stories  about  me,  but  twenty  minutes  later  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">important thing he'll have on his mind will be trying to find the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potato  salad  at  my  reception.  You  need  to  have  a  sense  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">humor about these things—especially if you work with people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comedian Victor Borge summed it up: "Laughter is the shortest</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance between two people." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  any  person  had  a  reason  to  take  his  job  and  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously,  it  is  the  president  of  the  United  States.  Yet  it's</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible for even people holding that position to maintain their</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense  of  humor  and  keep  their  egos  in  check.  For  example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  Calvin  Coolidge  was  asked  if  he  would  attend  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sesquicentennial  Exposition  in  Philadelphia,  the  president</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered, "Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you going, Mr. President?" a reporter asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>"As an exhibit," answered Coolidge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More recently, when George Bush was told that a company</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be selling a set of presidential trading cards for kids, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">response was, "I don't dare ask how many hundreds of George</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bush cards you have to trade to get one Michael Jordan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you tend to take yourself too seriously, give yourself and</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone  else  around  you  a  break.  Recognize  that  laughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">breeds resilience. </p>
